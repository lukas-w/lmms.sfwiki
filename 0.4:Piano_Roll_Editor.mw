{{0.4:Piano Roll EditorTrans}}

The '''Piano-roll''' editor is the main workspace for composing and editing melodies and harmonies.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/c/ce/Pianoroll-main.png

<br> 
It can be accessed by double-clicking (or right-clicking):
* a block in an instrument track e.g.: http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/51/Pattern-pianoroll.png
* a step in a track in the Beat+Bassline Editor <br> 
It can also be accessed using the '''Show/Hide Piano-Roll''' button in the main tool bar:

The Piano Roll toolbar looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

Many of the tools are similar to those found in the [[Song Editor]] with several important additions. <br> 
Also, editing is done a bit differently in the Piano-Roll editor, so you'll have to learn 2 slightly incompatible editing styles. <br>
'''''Warning! the Undo feature (Edit, Undo or Ctrl-Z) does not work!'''''

== Playback & Record ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/9/9e/Pianoroll-playback.png 

In addition to the Playback and Stop controls, there is a '''Record''' button which will record the notes you play on either:
* an attached [[0.4:Using MIDI|MIDI keyboard]], and/or
* your [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor#Keyboard|computer's keyboard]].
Press '''Stop''' to stop playback or recording. <br>
The computer keyboard's spacebar will toggle between Playback and Stop in both playback and record modes.

== Editing ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/f/f2/Pianoroll-editing.png

The 4 editing modes (tools) are '''Draw''', '''Erase''', '''Select''', and '''Detune'''.  The Draw and Erase modes are explained below in the [[#Notes|Notes]] section.

The '''Select''' mode tool allows you to select individual notes to create a group, or "'''selection'''", which you can then move, cut, copy, or paste. 
* '''Rectangular Selection''': use the Select tool to drag a rectangular area around some notes. When you release the mouse button, the selected notes will turn blue.
* '''Individual Selection''': use the Select tool to left-click on a note--it will turn blue.
* '''Add to Selection''': you can add more notes to the current selection by holding down the Shift key (Shift+drag or Shift+click) and the additional notes will turn blue, too.
* '''Remove from Selection''': can't find a way to do this
* '''Clear Selection''': left-click on an empty space in the Piano-Roll

| valign="top"|
The '''Detune''' mode tool allows you to edit the frequency profile of an individual note. When you click on a note, the [[0.4:Automation Editor|Automation Editor]] window opens for that note and is labeled "Note detuning". You can use your mouse to draw a frequency (pitch) profile graph in both higher and lower frequencies (pitches) than the base frequency (pitch) of the original note. This profile will be used to produce the final pitch (varying or not) of the note when played. Back in the Piano-Roll, the note will have yellow dots either above or below the note which indicates that it has been detuned and in which direction.

== Clipboard ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3f/Pianoroll-clipboard.png

The '''Clipboard''' buttons (above) allow you to cut, copy, and paste a selection, and the '''Delete''' key on the computer keyboard will delete the selected notes.
* Click the '''Copy''' button (Ctrl+C) to copy the selected note(s) and place them in the Clipboard. Shift+drag on the selected note(s) to drag a copy of the selected note(s) away from the original(s).
* Click the '''Cut''' button (Ctrl+X) to cut the selected note(s) (i.e. remove from Piano-Roll) and place in the Clipboard.
* Click the '''Paste''' button (Ctrl+V) to paste the note(s) from the Clipboard into the Piano-Roll (this does not empty the Clipboard, so you can do multiple paste actions with the same Clipboarded note(s)). Note these 2 things when pasting:
** Click on the timeline to position the playhead where you want to paste the Clipboarded note(s), because these note(s) will be pasted to the right of the position of the playhead on the timeline, but the distance from the playhead is sometimes unpredictable.
** The pasted note(s) are selected (blue) so you can immediately drag them to the exact position you want.

== Playback Control ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/31/Pianoroll-playbackcontrol.png <br> 
These work the same as the [[0.4:Song Editor#Playback_Controls|Playback Controls in the Song Editor]].

== Zoom ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/a3/Zoomsection.png <br> 
This works the same as the [[0.4:Song Editor#Zoom_Control|Zoom Control in the Song Editor]].

== Quantisation ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/1/19/Pianoroll-quantisation.png <br> 
The current Quantisation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(music)] setting is displayed and can be set using the drop-down menu. This allows you to set the minimum resolution for manipulating note start and end times on the timeline using that fraction of a bar, both when using the Draw mode tool and when using Record.

For example, if you set the Quantisation to 1/1 (i.e. 1 bar resolution), you'll only be able to place notes at the start of a whole bar, and you'll only be able to lengthen or shorten notes in 1-bar increments. You can extrapolate this example case to all the other available quantisation levels.

== Notes ==

=== Draw and Move Notes ===
'''''Tip''''': holding down the '''Ctrl''' key in Draw mode converts the mouse cursor to the Select mode tool, and it returns to the Draw mode tool when you release the Ctrl key. <br>
Use the '''Draw mode''' tool to place notes in the Piano-Roll. <br>
As you hover your mouse or move a note in the work area, the gray horizontal line helps you see the pitch of the note you're placing:
* '''left-click''' to place a note 
* '''right-click''' to delete a note
* hover over the center of a note until a '''4-headed arrow''' appears then:
** '''drag''' the note either left/right in time or up/down in pitch. This also works for a selection of notes. The note(s) will snap to the nearest time increment as set in the Quantisation drop-down.
** '''Alt+drag''' the note either left/right in time or up/down in pitch. This also works for a selection of notes. The note(s) will "free-drag" and snap to the nearest 1/192 time increment (i.e. max Quantisation).
* hover over the right-end of the note until a '''2-headed arrow''' appears then:
** '''drag''' the end of note either left/right to change the length of the note. This also works for a selection of notes. The right end of the note(s) will snap to the nearest time increment as set in the Quantisation drop-down.
** '''Alt-drag''' the end of note either left/right to change the length of the note. This also works for a selection of notes. The right end of the note(s) will "free-drag" and snap to the nearest 1/192 time increment (i.e. max Quantisation).

=== Erase Notes ===
Use the '''Erase mode''' tool to delete notes in the Piano-Roll:
* left-click to delete a note

=== Default Note Length ===

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/be/Pianoroll-notelength.png <br> 
The '''Default Note Length''' setting (in bar lengths) is displayed and can be set using a drop-down menu. <br> 
This sets the default length of notes made when you click in the Piano-Roll with the Draw mode tool. <br> 
You can choose either a given note length or that the next note will be the same length as the last note drawn.

=== Note Volume & Panning ===
Click on the '''Note Volume/Note Panning''' button below the piano keys to toggle between the Note Volume and Note Panning editor. <br>
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/4/49/Pianoroll-note-volume.png http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/74/Pianoroll-note-panning.png<br> 
The '''volume''' (loudness) of each note is termed '''velocity''' in music sequencing. Velocity is shown as a vertical green bar below the note in the Note Volume editor. You can change the velocity of each note by clicking somewhere on the vertical bar for that note or by dragging the orange box to the level you want. This info is set automatically when you record notes using a MIDI keyboard that is capable of transmitting the velocity of the notes as they are played.

The '''pan''' of each note is the ratio of the note volume that is transmitted out the right stereo channel versus the left stereo channel. Pan is shown as a vertical orange bar below the note in the Note Pan editor. By default, the pan is centered (equal volume out the left and right channels). You can change the velocity of each note by clicking somewhere on the vertical bar for that note or by dragging the orange box to the position you want.

The piano keyboard is on the left side of the window. <br> 
You can scroll up (higher pitch) and down (lower pitch) using either the scroll bar on the right side of the window or the scroll wheel on your mouse. <br> 
Click (or click-and-hold) on any piano key to hear the corresponding note.

== Computer Keyboard ==

[[File:keyboard-pianoKeys1.png|500px|thumb|right|Computer keyboard as a piano.]]
In the Piano-Roll window, you can use the computer keyboard to play notes in a 2-octave range. It starts from Z at C3 and goes horizontally across the bottom 2 rows of the keyboard to M playing B3 (i.e. Z X C V B N M play the natural notes and S D G H J play the sharps and flats). It continues with Q playing C4 and uses the top 2 rows of the keyboard to P playing E5 (i.e. Q W E R T Y U I O P play the natural notes and 2 3 5 6 7 9 0 play the sharps and flats). <br>
Also, an attached [[0.4:Using MIDI|MIDI keyboard]] can be used to play notes. <br>
Both the computer keyboard and a MIDI keyboard can be used to record notes when using the [[#Playback & Record|Record]] feature.
