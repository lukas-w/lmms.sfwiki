{{0.4:Piano Roll EditorTrans}}

The '''Piano-roll''' editor is the main workspace for composing and editing melodies and harmonies.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/c/ce/Pianoroll-main.png

<br> 
It can be accessed by double-clicking (or right-clicking):
* a block in an instrument track e.g.: http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/51/Pattern-pianoroll.png
* a step in a track in the Beat+Bassline Editor <br> 
It can also be accessed using the '''Show/Hide Piano-Roll''' button in the main tool bar:

The Piano Roll toolbar looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

Many of the tools are similar to those found in the [[Song Editor]] with several important additions. <br> 
Also, editing is done a bit differently in the Piano-Roll editor, so you'll have to learn 2 slightly incompatible editing styles.

== Playback ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/9/9e/Pianoroll-playback.png 

In addition to the Playback and Stop controls, there is a '''Record''' button which will record the notes you play on either:
* an attached [[0.4:Using MIDI|MIDI keyboard]], and/or
* your [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor#Keyboard|computer's keyboard]].
Press '''Stop''' to stop playback or recording. <br>
The computer keyboard's spacebar will toggle between Playback and Stop in both playback and record modes.

== Editing ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/f/f2/Pianoroll-editing.png

The 4 editing modes (tools) are '''Draw''', '''Erase''', '''Select''', and '''Detune'''.  The Draw and Erase modes are explained below in the [[#Notes|Notes]] section.

The '''Select''' mode tool allows you to select individual notes to create a group, or "'''selection'''", which you can then move, cut, copy, or paste. 
* '''Rectangular Selection''': use the Select tool to drag a rectangular area around some notes. When you release the mouse button, the selected notes will turn blue.
* '''Individual Selection''': use the Select tool to left-click on a note--it will turn blue.
* '''Add to Selection''': you can add additional notes to the current selection by holding down the Shift key (Shift+drag or Shift+click) and the additional notes will turn blue, too.
* '''Remove from Selection''': can't find a way to do this
* '''Clear Selection''': left-click on an empty space in the Piano-Roll

== Clipboard ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3f/Pianoroll-clipboard.png

The '''Clipboard''' buttons (above) allow you to cut, copy, and paste a selection, and the '''Delete''' key on the computer keyboard will delete the selected notes.
* Click the '''Copy''' button to copy the selected notes and place them in the Clipboard.
* Click the '''Cut''' (scissor) button to cut the selected notes (i.e. remove from Piano-Roll) and place them in the Clipboard.
* Click the '''Paste''' button to paste the notes in the Clipboard into the Piano-Roll (this does not empty the Clipboard, so you can do multiple paste actions with the same Clipboarded notes). Note these 2 things when pasting:
** Click on the timeline to position the playhead where you want to paste the Clipboarded notes, because these notes will be pasted to the right of the position of the playhead on the timeline, but the distance from the playhead is sometimes unpredictable.
** The pasted notes are selected (blue) so you can immediately drag them to the exact position you want.

== Playback Control ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/31/Pianoroll-playbackcontrol.png <br> 
These work the same as the [[0.4:Song Editor#Playback_Controls|Playback Controls in the Song Editor]].

== Zoom ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/a3/Zoomsection.png <br> 
This works the same as the [[0.4:Song Editor#Zoom_Control|Zoom Control in the Song Editor]].

== Quantisation ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/1/19/Pianoroll-quantisation.png <br> 
The current Quantisation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(music)] setting is displayed and can be set using the drop-down menu. This allows you to set the minimum resolution for setting note start and end times on the timeline using a fractional portion of a beat, both when using the Draw mode tool and when using Record.

== Notes ==

=== Note Length ===

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/be/Pianoroll-notelength.png <br> 
The current note length setting is displayed in another drop-down menu. <br> 
This controls the length of notes made with the creation tool. <br> 
You can either specify a given note length, or specify that the next note will be the same length as the last note.

=== Note Volume (Velocity) ===

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/4/49/Pianoroll-note-volume.png <br> 
The 'weight' of each note - its loudness or softness - is termed '''velocity''' in music sequencers. <br> 
This velocity is shown as a vertical bar at the bottom of the window. <br> 
You can change the velocity of each note by clicking on this bar and dragging it to its preferred location. <br> 
This information is also recorded when you record notes from a MIDI keyboard that is capable of recording the velocity of the notes as they are played.

=== Note Panning ===

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/74/Pianoroll-note-panning.png <br> 
Clicking on the note volume gives you the note panning and vice versa.
Here you can set the channel panning of each note, i.e. the position of the sound in the stereo field.

= Piano Keys =

Below the tool bar on the left-hand side of the window is the keyboard. <br> 
This shows a segment of a keyboard, seen side-on, that relates to the notes displayed in the piano roll.

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/ac/Pianoroll-keys.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

This can be scrolled up and down using the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the piano roll, or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse. <br> 
You can also click on this to play the corresponding note.


== Keyboard ==

[[File:keyboard-pianoKeys1.png|500px|thumb|right|keyboard as piano]]
You can use the keyboard of your computer to play notes in a two-octave range.  This starts from Z at C3 and goes horizontally across the bottom two rows of tke keyboard to M playing B3 - i.e. ZXCVBNM play the natural notes and SDGHJ play the sharps and flats.  It continues with Q playing C4 and uses the top two rows of the keyboard up to P playing E5 - i.e. QWERTYUIOP plays the natural notes and 2356790 play the sharps and flats.  In addition, any MIDI keyboard can be used to send MIDI command to this instrument when it's selected.
