The FX Mixer, as its name implies, is a tool for final edits to the song and its individual elements by adding ''Effects''.  This will bring up the mixer itself.

*The mixer has 4 racks, labelled ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D''.  Each with 16 tracks, which are made up of 2 channels, a left and a right, indicated by a volume indicator bar on each side of the fader.  By default, all plugins, files, and tracks are routed through the ''Master'' fader/track.  


*The ''Master'' fader controls the overall volume of the combined plugins and/or tracks, it also gives the ability to to apply an ''effect'' to all tracks/plugins.  To adjust the ''Master fader'' left click once on its name and then click ''Add effect''.  This will bring up the dialogue box for all the effect from which a single effect can be selected.


*Tracks work similarly to the ''Master'' fader, except that they can only control plugins.  However, a plugin must first be assigned to a track.  To assign a plugin select it from either the ''Song-editor'' or the ''Beat-editor'', depending on where it is located.  Once you have selected the plugin adjust the ''FX CHNL'' to whichever track you wish.  Any number of plugins can be assigned to a single track in order to achieve the same effect with each plugin (e.g. A drumkit effect).  Now that the desired plugins have been assigned, effects and volume adjustments may be added.  ''(Note: To change the title of a track double-click on the current title.)''
