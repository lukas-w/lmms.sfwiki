Mobile scaffolding of the lightning method 

First, the four corners of the <b>[http://www.iscaffold.com.cn scaffolding]</b> in housing on the pole stand, height not less than 1 meter, and all should be the top horizontal pole connected to form a lightning network. Rack installed in the vertical transport in the middle of a lightning rod should be set to the side of the pole above the top of the access not less than 2 meters, the lower end of the stand pole ground wire, and hoist chassis ground. 
  
Second, grounding wire should maximize the use of steel. Vertical grounding can be 1.5 to 2 meters long, 25 to 30 mm in diameter, wall thickness of not less than 2.5 mm steel pipe with a diameter not less than 20 mm angle steel bar or 50 * 5. Grounding can choose the length of the level of not less than 3 meters in diameter from 8 to 14 mm round or thickness of not less than 4 mm wide and 25 to 40 mm flat steel. Also buried in the ground can also be used metal pipes, metal post, drill pipe, water pipe and into a reliable connection with the earth as a grounding metal structure. Scaffolding on the ground electrode by a continuous length of 50 meters within the set one, and should meet the furthest point away from the ground within a scaffolding pole transition resistance on the requirements of not more than 10 ohms. Ground resistance shall not exceed 20 ohms. 
  
Third, the ground wire that is deflectors, can be not less than 16 mm2 cross-section of aluminum wire or a section of not less than 12 square millimeters of copper wire. In order to save non-ferrous metals can be used under the premise of a reliable connection is not less than 8 mm in diameter, round, or not less than 4 mm thick flat steel. Ground wire connection to be absolutely reliable contact, connect to contacts 

Paint and surface oxide removal, exposing metallic luster, and painted a neutral petroleum jelly. Ground wire and the grounding connection is best to use solder, solder ground wire length should be more than 6 times the diameter or more than 2 times the width of flat steel. Lightning protection should also note that setting the following: 

First, the grounding device before setting the limits under the grounding resistance, soil moisture and conductivity characteristics of the design, selection and location of grounding, and grounding wire grounding and layout, material selection, connection, production and installation requirements be specified. After the installation of sheet resistance measurement to use for compliance. 

Second, the grounding line position should be selected not easy to come to the local people in order to avoid hazards and reduce the step voltage to prevent the ground suffered mechanical damage, grounding and other metals or cables should be maintained between the distance of 3 meters or more. 

Third, the use of grounding devices in 6 months or more, should not be used in the ground as bare aluminum grounding wire or grounding wire. The soil in a strongly corrosive, use galvanized or copper grounding pole. 

Fourth, in case of lightning strikes during construction, the steel scaffolding on the operator should be immediately evacuated.
