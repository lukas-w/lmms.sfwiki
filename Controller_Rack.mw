'''Controllers''' are used to vary the position of a knob or other control over time using another signal such as an LFO waveform. Controllers differ from automation because automation uses a shape drawn manually by the user as its signal and usually the shape is not a repeated pattern such as a waveform. In contrast, LFO controllers use waveforms to give a regular pattern to the value of a control.

The '''Controller Rack''' displays all the controllers created within this project.
* There are 2 types of controllers (explained in sections below):
** LFO controller
** Peak controller
* The right-click context menu allows you only 1 option: "Remove this controller". You cannot change the names of the controllers.

== LFO Controller == 


LFO stands for '''Low Frequency Oscillator'''.

This button is the Controller Rack show/hide toggle button ('''F11'''). To add an LFO Controller entry to the Controller Rack, click the Add button at the bottom of the Controller Rack window.

To edit the settings for a particular LFO Controller entry, click the Controls button on the right side of the entry. The LFO controller settings are:
* 8 waveform option buttons
* 4 knobs
** BASE: Base is the center (or zero line) around which the wave oscillates
** SPD: Speed is the rate (frequency) of wave oscillation
** AMT: Amount is the size (amplitude) of the wave
** PHS: Phase Offset is where in the waveform the wave starts its first oscillation
* 3 speed-multiplier option buttons

== Peak Controller ==

A '''Peak Controller''' allows you to use the volume peaks from an audio source to automate the values of a control. A Peak Controller is similar to a Gate, but with greater flexibility. Peak controllers commonly use the output signal of a percussion track to control the volume of a sustained sound on a different track. This results in the sustained sound being chopped up in time with the percussion, and has been used by artists such as Madonna (Vogue) and Seal (Crazy) to create very distinctive sounds. In LMMS, when you add a Peak Controller it is visible in the Controller Rack, but it's actually an '''effect''' applied to an FX-channel--see [[0.4:FX Mixer|the FX-Mixer page]] for info on how to use effects. If you click on the "Controls" button on the Peak Controller entry in the Controller Rack, you'll get a window telling you to use the FX-channel's controls (magenta arrow). Therefore, to get to the Peak Controller settings, click the "Controls" button on the Peak Controller entry in the Effects Chain box (yellow arrow). Note that an FX-channel can have more than one Peak Controller entry.
