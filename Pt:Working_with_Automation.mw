Note that the problems mobile scaffolding 

(A) moving the scaffolding <b>[http://www.iscaffold.com.cn scaffolding]</b> load over 15KN/mm2. To distinguish those parts of the tube length changes greater impact on the load, the upper part of the template free length of stent should be considered a not too long, generally less than 500mm suitable (in the new specification may be revised), the general calculation Pole the top step and bottom step of the maximum force should be calculated as the main point. Capacity requirements should be satisfied when the group increased to reduce pole step. 

(2) The prevalence of domestic scaffolding steel, fasteners, backwater, and the end of substandard quality care and other materials, the actual construction of the theoretical calculations do not take them into account. Sweeping bar missing, vertical and horizontal junction is not connected, sweeping shot from the distance is too large or too small, etc.; scaffold board listed, the thickness is not enough, do not meet the specifications overlap; large formwork removal of the medial pole and the wall thickness is not between anti-dropping network; scissors in the plane did not continuous; opening brace scaffolding is not set; small bar under the scaffold board spacing is too large; even failed to do inside and outside wall rigid parts.
