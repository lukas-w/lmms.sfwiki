LMMS is very flexible when it comes to theming its interface. All the image files used by the program can be accessed directly through a directory and edited by an image editor. Unfortunately, despite the ease, there hasn't been much interest in theme development; only a few themes have made it to the [http://lsp.lmms.info/?action=browse&category=UI%20themes LMMS Sharing Platform], where they can be downloaded, rated, and commented on by users. This guide aims to help, guide, and motivate artists interested in creating themes, and interest those who aren't.

== About Theming ==

A ''theme'' is a collection of files (mostly images) that set the "look and feel" of LMMS. It consists of a ''.css'' stylesheet, an ''.xml'' file, and many ''.png'' images. It can be usually downloaded as a ''.tar.gz'' archive which has to be extracted in the ''themes'' directory.

On a regular install on Linux, the default ''themes'' directory is: 
 /usr/share/lmms/themes/
On Windows it's in the ''themes'' folder inside the LMMS installation directory.

=== Prerequisites ===
To create a new theme, or to modify an existent one, some fairly basic knowledge is required:
* image manipulation skills ''(gimp, inkscape, paint, ..)''
* browsing through directories
* compressing files into archives
* LMMS Sharing Platform account

=== Remember ===
-The default theme is named ''default'', and can be found in the ''themes'' folder.<br>
-Each theme has its own folder with its images inside.<br>
-If your theme is missing some files, LMMS will use the default ones.<br>
-Capitalization matters on Linux.

== Getting Started ==
The best thing is to make a copy of the ''default'' folder, rename that copy (i.e. ''"MyTheme"''), and then open the image files with an image editor and modify them as you wish. You can also replace them completely, but be careful with the image dimensions: sometimes they can be a bit different; sometimes they cannot!

== Testing Your Theme ==
To test your theme, all you need to do is open LMMS, go to Edit->Settings->Paths (folder icon), and enter the path to your new theme folder.

== Sharing Your Theme ==
Once your theme is complete, it's a great idea to compress it to ''.tar.gz'' and share it with the community :) The [http://lsp.lmms.info/?action=browse&category=UI%20themes LMMS Sharing Platform] is the best place for that. Remember that you'll need to register to upload content (it's free).
*Just be cautious about licences and patent infringements if you used others' images!
