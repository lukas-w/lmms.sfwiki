The Song Editor displays the structure of your song.

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-songeditor-simple.png

Down the left-hand side of the window are listed the instrument and beat/bassline tracks available; on the right of these is listed the activity of each track at each bar in the song. For beat lines this is simply a block showing that the beat/bassline is active; Instruments will have a small display of the notes in a piano roll. Double-clicking on this small note display will bring up the Piano Roll editor for that instrument at that point in time.

== The anatomy of a track ==

Each track has a section on the left hand side that shows the track tools and settings.  The right hand side displays the segments of audio that the track will play over time.  The right hand side scrolls left and right to show you a window of time from the song; the whole song editor scrolls up and down to show you the various tracks.

Each track's activity is divided into '''segments'''.  For instrument tracks, these display a miniature piano roll; for beat-bassline tracks it simply displayed a filled (shaded) coloured bar for the length of the beat or bassline; for sample tracks it displays a miniature wave display of the sample.

== Adding new tracks ==

You can add new instrument track to the song editor by dragging them from the Side Bar. The instrument's [[Plugins plugin]] will be displayed, allowing you to make any changes you need to the sound of the instrument. You can dispel this plugin display by using its close button or by clicking on the instrument name button in the song editor.

To add a new beat or bassline track, click the '''add beat/bassline''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-songeditor-button-new-bassline.png) to add a new bassline.  Alternatively, you can open the Beat & Bassline Editor and click the '''add beat/bassline''' button (same symbol) to the right of the bassline selector.  You can then right-click on the name of the beat/bassline in the song editor in order to rename it to something more identifiable.

To add a new sample track, click the '''add sample-track''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-songeditor-button-new-sampletrack.png) to add a new sample track.

Note that there is no button allowing you to add a new instrument track.  This is because you would have to select a plugin for the instrument before the track was created, and this is far easier to do by tradding the correct plugin or preset from the [[Side Bar]].

== Ordering your tracks ==

You can drag instruments and beat/bassline tracks up and down in order to organise them by dragging the stippled handle on the left-hand side of the instrument line. You can also change the colour of the track by right-clicking on a segment of the track and choosing 'Change color' from the drop-down menu, allowing you to easily see track groupings.  You can also change the icon of the track to more accurately reflect what instrument it is.  The button next to the stippled handle is a drop-down menu for the track controls, allowing you to clone or remove the track.

== Working with Segments ==

Despite their different content, the ways of working with segments are mostly similar.  Most of the work with segments is done using the insert tool (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-songeditor-button-insert-tool.png).

To create a new segment, simply left-click on the track activity inside the bar in which you want the segment to start.  For instrument and sample tracks, this creates a blank area to put notes or samples in.  For beat and bassline tracks, this creates one bar filled with the bassline as programmed.

To move a segment, simply drag it around by clicking and holding anywhere inside the segment.  Normally this will lock to the start of the bar, but you can free drag (with a 1/64th resolution) the segment by pressing the ''control'' key down ''once you have started dragging''.

To copy a segment, simply hold the ''control'' key down ''before you click'' and then drag the segment to its copies' new location.  You can also right-click on the segment, choose ''copy'' from the context menu, click to create a new sample where you want the copy to go, right click and choose ''paste'' from the menu.  You can't copy segments of one type to tracks of another type, however.

To delete a segment, click on it using the middle mouse button or right-click on it and choose 'delete' from the context menu.

Double-clicking on a segment aims to work with the contents of that segment.  If you double-click on an instrument track segment, the [[Piano Roll Editor]] window will open and the notes in that segment will be displayed for editing.  If you double-click on a sample track segment, a file open dialog will display allowing you to choose a new sample for that segment.  If you double-click on a beat or bassline segment, the Beat + Bassline Editor window will open and that beat or bassline will be displayed.

= The Song Editor toolbar =

The Song Editor window has a toolbar that allows you to control playback of the song, add new tracks, choose edit tools, customise the method of playback, and control the view of the song.

= The Track Context menu =

The track context menu appears when you right-click on a segment of a track's activity.
