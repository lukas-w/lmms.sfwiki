The main menu bar gives you various options to control the overall functioning of LMMS:

= Project Menu =

The Project menu allows you to load, save and export projects and import MIDI files.

'''New''' creates a new project.

'''Open''' gives you a dialog to choose an existing project file to open.

'''Recently opened Projects''' opens up a submenu listing all the recent project files you have opened, so that you can easily open a project you were recently working on.  This does not include a project that you have just created and saved, so you have to open the project at least once before it will show up in this menu.

'''Save''' saves the current project if it has already been saved.  If not it functions as if you had chosen 'Save as'.

'''Save As''' gives you a dialog to choose a (new) location and name to save your project in.

'''Import''' allows you to import MIDI and other files as new instrument lines.

'''Export''' allows you to export your song as an uncompressed WAV file or compressed OGG file.  No MP3 file export support is planned.  Once you have chosen a name and location to save the file, you then get presented with a dialog:

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/menu-project-export-settings.png

This allows you to choose the format of the file and, for OGG files, the bit rate and bit rate management method (these settings are ignored for WAV files).  Please note that, at this stage, the format chosen here and the extension you used on the file in the export file dialog are not synchronised automatically - you must set them the same manually to end up with a file which is named correctly for its content.  You can also choose whether to use the [[Tool Bar#Sound_Quality_Controls|High Quality Mode]] when performing the song.

On pressing 'OK' the song will be performed from where the playback point was last set.  To get the entire song exported you should check that the playback mark is at the start of the song before exporting it.

= Edit Menu =

The two options typically in this menu are '''Undo''' and '''Redo'''.  These can be also accessed by pressing the common keys Ctrl-Z and Shift-Ctrl-Z, respectively.  They allow you to step backward, or forward, through a history of edits to your project, reversing mistaken actions or re-applying them.

In this version the undo feature only works correctly for some forms of editing.  In particular, in the [[Piano Roll Editor]] the bulk move, copy and paste facilities using the selection tool and/or clipboard do not get undone or redone correctly.  The developers are aware of this problem and are working on a fix in a future version.

= Settings Menu =

These two menu items allow you various ways to configure how LMMS works.  '''Show settings dialog''' gives you a full display of all the configurable options in LMMS, while '''Show setup wizard''' will walk you through configuring the most popular options in LMMS.  For more details on these see the [[LMMS Settings]] documentation.

= Tools Menu =

The only option currently in this menu is the '''Live Tool'''.  The [[Live Tool]] can be used to control instruments during a performance, but is also useful when previewing a mix checking the levels of various instruments.  When it is open, pressing F1 - F10 will mute or unmute the first ten instruments in the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] and the Space bar will toggle playback in the Song Editor.

= Help Menu =

There are three items in the Help menu.

* '''Help''' is planned to show a complete help system.  However, at this stage this option will only display a message saying no help is available and referring you to this site.
* '''What's This?''' changes your cursor into a help cursor.  When you click on any part of a LMMS window, you will then see the contextual help for this item.  Much of the help is in place but some items are still awaiting text being written for them.
* '''About''' gives you a dialog which lists the LMMS project's home page, its key developers, translation information if you are using LMMS in a language other than English, and the GNU GPL license that the software is released under.
