The Tool Bar is at the top of the window, permanently underneath the [[Main Menu Bar]].  It looks like this:

= File Controls =

The first four buttons in the top row deal with opening and saving files.

The '''New Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-new-project.png) creates a new song.  By clicking on the drop-down symbol on the right hand side of the icon, you will get a list of pre-set templates that can be used to fill out your new song with instruments and configure it ready for work.

The '''Open Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-open-project.png) opens an existing song file in your LMMS Working Directory.

The '''Save Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-save.png) saves the current project.  If you have not yet saved the project you will be prompted for a name and location to save it.

The '''Export Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-export.png) exports the current project as a WAV or OGG file.  It will export it from the current play location in the [[Song Editor]] so be sure to set the play location to the first bar if you want the entire song exported.

= Window Controls =

The five buttons at the left of the bottom row shows or hides various windows.  When clicked, the action depends on the location of the corresponding window.  If the window selected is not at the front of the LMMS window, it is brought to the front.  If it is at the front, it is closed.  If it is closed, it is opened and brought to the front.  The contents of the window do not disappear when the window is closed.

The '''Beat + Bassline Editor Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-bassline.png) shows or hides the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]].

The '''Piano Roll Editor Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-pianoroll.png) shows or hides the [[Piano Roll Editor]].  You cannot edit in this window, however - you must double-click a piano roll segment in order to edit it.  The window will then display automatically.

The '''Song Editor Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-songeditor.png) shows or hides the [[Song Editor]].

The '''Automation Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-automation.png) shows or hides the [[Automation Editor]].  Like the Piano Roll Editor, this does nothing as is; open the automation of a particular control using its context menu to open the automation of that control.

The '''Project Notes''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-notes.png) shows or hides the [[Project Notes]] window.

= Tempo Control =

The current '''tempo''' (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-tempo.png) is shown in orange 7-segment numerals.  This is a standard control, so it can be changed by dragging up and down inside it and it can be automated from its context menu.

= Sound Quality Controls =

Beneath the tempo control are two controls that set the quality of the sound produced by LMMS.

The '''High Quality''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-highquality.png) turns on use of higher precision mathematics in all the instruments.  This will generally increase the quality of the sound - reducing artifacts and obvious clipping - at the expense of increased CPU usage.  It may also alter the sound of some [[LADSPA]] effects, particularly reverbs.

The '''Auto Limit''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-autolimit.png) activates a soft limiting function that prevents the sound from hitting the maximum or minimum extents of the 16-bit precision of a WAV file.  This can make some sounds softer but will avoid having clipping if a chance resonance or constructive interference should occur during your song.

= Volume and Pitch Controls =

To the right of the tempo control are the master volume and pitch controls.

The '''Master Volume''' control (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-master-volume.png) sets the master volume for the entire song.

The '''Master Pitch''' control (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-master-pitch.png) sets the 'root' note on which every other note in the song is based.  Turn this down to make the piece play at a lower pitch, and vice versa.  This can be useful if you have programmed a reproduction of another song to be in a certain key and, upon checking it against the original, find the original to be in a different key.

= Wave and CPU Usage Display =

Finally, the '''Wave / CPU Display''' (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-wave-cpu.png) displays the current waveform being played during playback and the current CPU usage of all the LMMS instruments, effects and sequencing.  You can turn the wave display off or on by clicking it, although this does little to reduce CPU usage.
