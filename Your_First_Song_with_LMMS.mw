= Choosing the instrument =

You've got the default screen in front of you, with the [[Song Editor]], [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] and [[Project Notes]] open.  First, click the Presets icon (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-sidebar-retracted-preset.png) on the [[Side Bar]] to open up the list of '''preset''' sounds.  Double-click on the '''TripleOscillator''' to open this folder and you will be presented with a diverse range of instruments.  You can hold the mouse button down on any preset to hear a preview of its sound.  Drag the "Moog" preset onto the space in the middle of the Song Editor and, when you drop it, a new track will be created with that preset as the instrument.{{ref|1}}
