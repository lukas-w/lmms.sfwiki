So you've just loaded up LMMS and you want to find your way around?  In this situation, programmers write a "hello world" program; we're going to write "Popcorn", a classic for the synthesiser that should be well known.

= Choosing the instrument =

You've got the default screen in front of you, with the [[Song Editor]], [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] and [[Project Notes]] open.  First, click the Presets icon (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/sidebar-retracted-preset.png) on the [[Side Bar]] to open up the list of '''preset''' sounds.  Double-click on the '''TripleOscillator''' to open this folder and you will be presented with a diverse range of instruments.  You can hold the mouse button down on any preset to hear a preview of its sound.

Drag the "'''Moog'''" preset onto the space in the middle of the Song Editor and, when you drop it, a new track will be created with that preset as the instrument.{{ref|1}}  The instrument plugin will then be displayed.  At this stage we're happy with how that instrument sounds, so click on its plugin button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-settings-plugin-moog.png) to close it again.

= Making the melody =

We now want to add notes to make the melody.  Left-click in the first bar of the Moog track and a new piano roll segment will appear (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-segment-piano-empty.png).  Double-click on that and the [[Piano Roll Editor]] will appear, allowing you to put notes into that newly-created segment.

== The first note ==

Now click in the black square just to the right of the 'A4' note (which is three lines, or semitones, down from the note marked C5).  This will create a new crotchet - a note one beat long - starting at that time.

However, this is too long: we need notes half a beat - a quaver - long.  To change this, we simply move the mouse pointer to the right-hand edge of the note, until the cursor changes into a left-and-right arrow.  Then we hold the mouse button down and drag the end of the note left two 'blocks' (each block being one sixteenth of a bar).

After this, the new notes we put down will be the same length, because the Piano Roll Editor is set to Last Note (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-notelen-last.png)

== More notes ==

Continue creating notes in the pattern shown:

= Footnotes =

{{note|1}} - You could alternatively have dropped it on the existing "TripleOscillator: Default" track to replace that instrument with the one you were dragging, but this gives you an idea of how to create new instrument tracks.
