So you've just loaded up LMMS and you want to find your way around?  In this situation, programmers write a "hello world" program; we're going to write "Popcorn", a classic for the synthesiser that should be well known.

= Choosing the instrument =

You've got the default screen in front of you, with the [[Song Editor]], [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] and [[Project Notes]] open.  First, click the Presets icon (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/sidebar-retracted-preset.png) on the [[Side Bar]] to open up the list of '''preset''' sounds.  Double-click on the '''TripleOscillator''' to open this folder and you will be presented with a diverse range of instruments.  You can hold the mouse button down on any preset to hear a preview of its sound.

Drag the "'''Moog'''" preset onto the space in the middle of the Song Editor and, when you drop it, a new track will be created with that preset as the instrument.{{ref|1}}  The instrument plugin will then be displayed.  At this stage we're happy with how that instrument sounds, so click on its plugin button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-settings-plugin-moog.png) to close it again.

= Making the melody =

We now want to add notes to make the melody.  Left-click in the first bar of the Moog track and a new piano roll segment will appear (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-segment-piano-empty.png).  Double-click on that and the [[Piano Roll Editor]] will appear, allowing you to put notes into that newly-created segment.

== The first note ==

Now click in the black square just to the right of the 'A4' note (which is three lines, or semitones, down from the note marked C5).  This will create a new crotchet - a note one beat long - starting at that time.

However, this is too long: we need notes half a beat - a quaver - long.  To change this, we simply move the mouse pointer to the right-hand edge of the note, until the cursor changes into a left-and-right arrow.  Then we hold the mouse button down and drag the end of the note left two 'blocks' (each block being one sixteenth of a bar).

After this, the new notes we put down will be the same length, because the Piano Roll Editor is set to Last Note (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-notelen-last.png)

== More notes ==

Continue creating notes in the pattern shown:

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/tutorial-1stsong/first-bar.png

To place a note, you need to aim for the line at the start of the beat; LMMS will recognise a small fraction of the area left of the beat line as being closer to that beat than the previous.  If you make a mistake placing a note, you can move it to its correct position by clicking on the middle of the note (where the cursor turns into a four-way cross) and dragging the note to its new position.  LMMS will play the note that you're dragging onto as an aide to correct placement.  You can move notes horizontally (in time) as well as vertically (in pitch).

If you need to delete a note, simply right-click on it.

== Copy and paste ==

We now want to repeat those seven notes at the start of the bar in the next bar.  One way to do that is to simply click the correct notes.  But, for this tutorial, we'll introduce the Piano Roll's copy and paste functions.

Click on the '''area selector''' tool in the Piano Roll toolbar's editing palette (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-editing.png), which is the third icon from the left - the dashed-outline square.  Now drag an area from the top-right (e.g. the C5 line in bar 2) to the bottom left (onto the G3 key).  You'll see a blue rectangle expand out and the notes that start inside this area will turn blue.  To select all the notes you will need to drag slightly onto the keyboard, something which is possible when dragging ''onto'' the keyboard but not ''off'' it (which is why we started dragging from the top right).

Once you have selected all the notes, press the '''copy''' button in the toolbar's clipboard palette (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-clipboard.png), which is the middle icon, looking like a page on top of another.  This copies these notes into a clipboard.  They will be pasted back into the first bar of the piano roll, so we need to move the current notes out of the way.

Fortunately, the '''move area''' tool in the editing palette, looking like a four-direction arrow, allows you to move all the notes in a selected area.  Select this tool and grab anywhere inside the selection to move it so that the first note is in the second bar.  It may be handy to actually grab one note, or note where the horizontal note shading lies when you start dragging, because you will find you often drag the notes up or down as well and we want to make sure we keep them at the same pitch.  Ensure that the first note is on the A4 line and starts on the first beat of the second bar.

Now we can paste the notes back in.  Press the '''paste''' button in the clipboard palette to paste the notes we previously copied back into the first bar.{{ref|2}}

= Footnotes =

{{note|1}} - You could alternatively have dropped it on the existing "TripleOscillator: Default" track to replace that instrument with the one you were dragging, but this gives you an idea of how to create new instrument tracks.

{{note|2}} - As of version 0.3.1, the copy and paste functionality in the Piano Roll Editor has several known problems.  The developers are aware of these problems and plan to fix them in a future release.
