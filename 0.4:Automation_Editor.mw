{{0.4:Automation EditorTrans}}

The Automation Editor allows you to control the value of any automatable control at any point in time during the song. This allows you anything from very simple effects like turning up the volume of an instrument at the start of the song, to very complex manipulation of the envelopes or filters of the instrument itself. Even the controls in [[LADSPA|LADSPA Effects]] can be automated!

If you open the Automation Editor with its button or '''F8''', and it looks like the image below, then close it, and double-click on an Automation track block instead.

'''Controls''' are the knobs, sliders, LED toggle switches, digital readouts, etc, that can be found on the GUIs within LMMS. All controls on default LMMS GUIs can be automated, including the following types:
* LED toggles
* Digital readouts
* Option buttons
* Sliders
* Knobs
* Drop-down Menus
If you're unsure if a control can be automated, right-click on its icon and look for a context menu item called '''Edit song-global automation'''. If it's there, the item probably can be automated; however, in the case of instruments, only the controls on the '''built-in LMMS instruments''' can be automated. You '''cannot''' automate any controls on third-party VST instruments, including '''zynAddSubFX''', even though it is included with LMMS.

= Automation Editor Toolbar =

The toolbar for the Automation Editor controls much of its functionality, and is similar in many ways to the toolbars of other windows.

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/8/8d/Automation-editor-toolbar.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The fundamental tools are similar in behaviour to their equivalents in the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor#Piano Roll Tool Bar|Piano Roll Editor]] and their description is not repeated here.  The main changes are:

* There is no record functionality (that I know of).
* There are 2 zoom controls: one for the horizontal and one for the vertical dimension of the window.

= Editing automation =

This is a typical view of the automation window:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/1/14/Automation-editor2.png 
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The window title '''Automation Editor-Lead>Volume''' tells you that you are editing the automation graph of the "Volume" control that belongs to the track named "Lead".

The main part of the window is a '''graph''' of the '''value''' of the control over '''time'''. Time is listed along the horizontal axis (at the top of the window) in the units of bars (aka the "timeline"). The value of the control is listed along the vertical axis at the left of the window in whatever units the control uses. Within the graphing area, the mouse cursor is linked to the horizontal and vertical axes by red lines to make it easier to see where you are working in both dimensions. How you should interpret the bar numbers in the Automation Editor depends on which method you are using to automate a control: [[0.4:Working with Automation#Song-global vs Automation Tracks|Song-global or Automation Track]].

The orange part of the graph provides an easy way to see the curve of the graph. The area between the curve and zero is shaded orange. In the case of a volume control, all the values are zero or greater, so zero is at the bottom of the value scale. For controls where the value can be negative, for example, a stereo pan control, the "zero line" is in the middle of the graph and orange shading can occur on either side of the zero line.

== Control Points ==

The actual value of the control at any point in time is dictated by the last '''control point''' at or before that time.  This is a zoomed-in view of a control point:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/automation-point-zoomed.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The yellow "dot" is the '''control point'''. There can only by 1 control point for any point in time; therefore, you'll be unable to stack 2 points on the same vertical line. The Automation Editor displays only 16 vertical lines per bar, so if a control point is not on a visible vertical line, remember that it's on an '''invisible''' vertical line that it cannot share.

== Drawing Control Points ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/e1/Button-pencil.png
Using the '''Draw mode''' tool (pencil), you can create new control points simply by clicking on (or near) a vertical line or by dragging in any direction over the graph. If a control point already exists somewhere on that vertical line, it will be moved up or down to the new location. If a control point does not exist on that vertical line, it will be created there. You can move an existing point up or down its vertical line by dragging it directly--it will look more like you're dragging the vertical orange bar that belongs to that point rather than dragging a point. You can delete a control point by right-clicking (same as deleting a note in the Piano Roll Editor). The hotkey to switch to the Draw mode tool is '''Shift+D'''.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/5f/Automation-editor-quantisation.png 
The timeline spacing of control points as you draw is set by the '''Q''' (quantisation) setting.  By default this is set to 1/16 which means 16 control points per bar (or a control point vertical line every 1/16th of a bar). You don't have to have a control point at every point that it's possible to have one--a horizontal line only requires 2 control points (one at each end).

== Working on Multiple Control Points ==

Operations such as cut, copy, paste, delete, and move selection operate on 1 or more '''selected''' control points.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/bb/Button-movetool.png The '''Select mode''' tool allows you to drag a rectangular area around 1 or more points to select them. The vertical orange bar of the point(s) will turn blue. Use ''Ctrl+A'' to select all the control points in the Automation Editor window. You can then cut, copy, and/or paste the selected points. The '''Paste''' operation preserves both the timeline position (horizontal value) and the control value (vertical value) of the control points. Be aware that the vertical value might not make sense for a different control. After pasting, the pasted points are still selected, which allows you to move them as a group (see next).

[[File:LMMS-move-tool.png]] The '''Move Selection mode''' tool allows you to move (by dragging) the selected control points and without regard for the Q setting. The selection will move at the maximum Q of 1/192. This is similar to the "free drag" (Alt+drag) of notes in the Piano Roll. Beware while moving a selection that any existing points that the selection passes over will be deleted!

Use the '''Delete''' key on the computer keyboard to delete a selection of points.

== Erasing Control Points ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/eb/Button-eraser.png 
The '''Erase mode''' tool can delete control points, as can right-clicking on them. <br>
