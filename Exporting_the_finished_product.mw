= Before exporting =
     
After song production is finished it is time to export it.  But, before you export the song you will want to check the status of the ''High quality mode'' button.  If the high quality mode is ON the song will sound cleaner when the final product is exported, however if having it active distorts your original piece then leave it as is.

When the high quality mode is inactive it will look like this: http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9365/export4bq0.png

Once it has been activated it will look like this: http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4800/export5bc5.png

(Warning: If you are using a computer with low system resources then only turn high quality mode on when you are ready to export it, otherwise your system may run slow during previews.)

= Exporting the song =

There are two ways to export a song.  You could either click on the export button: http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1027/exportrf5.png

Or you can go to Project|Export (Ctrl+E).

After this choose a name for the song (e.g. File-Name-Here .wav) and a location to save the exported song.
