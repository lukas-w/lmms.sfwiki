== Before exporting ==
     
After you have finished building your song it is time to export it.  But, before you export your song you will want to check the status of the 'High quality mode' button.  If high quality mode is on you will get a better cleaner noise when you final product is exported, however if having it active distorts your original piece then leave it as is.

When the high quality mode is inactive it will look like this: http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9365/export4bq0.png

Once it has been activated or it will look like this: http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4800/export5bc5.png

(Warning: If you are using a computer with low system resources then only turn high quality mode on when you are ready to export it, otherwise your system may run slow during previews.)
