= Before exporting =
     
After song production is finished it is time to export the song.  But, before you export the song you will want to check the status of the ''High quality mode'' button.  If the high quality mode is ON the song will sound cleaner when the final product is exported, however if having it active distorts your original piece then leave it as is.

When the high quality mode is inactive it will look like this: http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9365/export4bq0.png

Once it has been activated it will look like this: http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4800/export5bc5.png

(Warning: If you are using a computer with low system resources then only turn high quality mode on when you are ready to export it, otherwise your system may run slow during previews.)

= Exporting the song =

There are two ways to get to the export utility.  You could either click on the export button: http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1027/exportrf5.png

Or you can go to Project|Export (Ctrl+E).

After this choose a name for the song (e.g. File-Name-Here .wav) and a location to save the exported song.

Following this there will be the ''Export Project'' window.  This window displays all the export options that can be used to adjust the quality and precision of the exported song file.

== File format ==

There are two options given in this window:

# *.wav or waveform audio format is usually the best choice for newer users because it can be read on most computers and media devices (and other applications) without conversion.
# *.ogg or ogg vorbis format is a "lossy" format (like jpg) that does not preserve 100% of the quality of the original track, but which results in a much smaller file size than .wav. It may be a better choice for online distribution or other situations where space is a concern, however this format is more limited in what devices (and applications) it can be played on.

== Samplerate ==

This option is allows a person to adjust how many times the song will be sampled per second.  The more times the song is sampled per second the more sensitive the exporter will be to changes in the song.  In other words, if you have a lot of changes over a short amount of time you will want a much higher sample rate.  In general this should be left as is, because if it is turned down too low the song with not progress properly and may make the final product sound distorted.  On the other hand, if the sample rate is turned up too high the song file will become extremely large and take much longer when being processed by the exporting tool.

== Bitrate ==

Bit rate refers to the amount/speed at which the song is processed by the device reading it.  This option is important because it allows for choice of both quality and size of the song file.  The higher the bit rate the better the quality of the music being read.  However, a higher bit rate also means a larger song file.  The following list gives comparable examples of bit rates.

| 256 KBit/s ||  = High Quality MP3 ||
|----- bgcolor="#EEEEFF"
| 320 KBit/s ||  =< CD Quality ||
|}

== Depth ==

In simple terms this represents the way that the processor in the computer interacts with the program in terms of scientific notation or integer format while the song is being encoded.  Choosing the ''32 bit float'' will allow the computer to do a more accurate compilation of the song, however it requires more processing power to achieve this better standard of precision.   Using the ''16 bit integer'' will allow for faster processing, especially on older or underpowered computers.  In general to achieve a better sounding song this setting should be set to ''32 bit float''.
