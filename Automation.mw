Controls are the "knobs" and "sliders" that can be found on the GUIs of LMMS. All controls on default LMMS GUIs can be bound to an Automation track, and hence be automated. Remember that you can '''connect''' (bind) multiple controls to the ''same'' block in an automation track. For a specific automation track, you can list the connected controls by right-clicking the block in the Song-Editor, and the '''Connections''' (connected controls) will be listed at the bottom. The  "connections" context menu item gives you the option to release (disconnect) a connected control from that automation block.
