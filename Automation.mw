All controls on default LMMS GUIs can be bound to an Automation track, and hence be automated. Controls are the knobs, sliders and buttons that can be found in LMMS. Remember that you can connect multiple controls to the ''same'' block in an automation track. For a specific automation track, you can list the connected controls by right-clicking the block in the Song-Editor, and the connected controls will be listed at the bottom. The  connections context menu item gives you the option to disconnect a connected control from that automation block.
