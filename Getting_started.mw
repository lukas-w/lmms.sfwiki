=== How to get up and running with LMMS ===

OK. This is going to be very brief, but I thought a few helpful pointers might be useful for people to avoid the 3 hours plus that I spent trying to load instrument plugins in LMMS (0.1.1).

Once you fire up LMMS there are two main windows you use all the time: the song editor and the beat/bassline editor.

To insert a new instrument plugin into the beat/bassline editor, click the yellow star on the left hand side of the main window (my presets). This gives directories containing presets for the main plugins: double click one of the presets to insert them into the beat/bassline editor.

If you make a mistake, or want to change an instrument, click it's grey button within the beat/bassline editor so you can view it's editor window, then right click on the preset you want to change it to and click "send to active channel".

With the audiofile processor plugin, the presets are a bit weird for normal use.. just select the Kick-4-your subwoofer patch, load your new sample and increase the sustain.

The drum pattern editing is pretty self-explanatory. If you double click the drum editing, it opens a piano-roll so you can edit bassline patterns instead. The volume for each note is at the bottom of the piano roll (as expected).

You can insert instruments direcly into the song-editor (for long improvisation pieces etc) but for loop-based music it is best to write each loop for each instrument in a different beat/bassline editor (they all use the same instrument stack) and then put the piece together in the song-editor.
