= Track types =

The fundamental unit that you work with in the Song Editor is a track.  Each track is a row in the song editor window; the left part of the track controls the type of track and the right part displays when sounds are going to be created by that track.  This sounds like a generalisation, because it is - tracks can be of a number of different types, and each type of track has a different way of working.
