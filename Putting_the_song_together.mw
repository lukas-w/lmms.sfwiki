You use the [[Song Editor]] to link the various sounds, rhythms and melodies together into a complete performance.

= Track types =

The fundamental unit that you work with in the Song Editor is a track.  Each track is a row in the song editor window; the left part of the track controls the type of track and the right part displays when sounds are going to be created by that track.  This sounds like a generalisation, because it is - tracks can be of a number of different types, and each type of track has a different way of working.

== Sample Tracks ==

Typically, sample tracks are used to include recordings of singers or instruments playing a melody line.  This allows you to have live musicians alongside the music in your LMMS projects.  However, as yet there are no facilities to trim the start of the sample, or to tune it or scale it to fit with the bars in your music.  These should be done in an audio editing program such as [http://audacity.sourceforge.net Audacity] beforehand.

Sample tracks are the simplest type of track because they only have a volume control and an effects chain.

== Bassline Tracks ==
-are default blue. They are different from instrumental tracks in one significant way: They can be drag-expanded! While an instrument track has the content and length that was created in the piano-roll, a beat-bassline track (BB-track) could have any length (above one). Drag your mouse from the end of the BB-track and it will expand. (Dragging in an instrument-track will move it) You can of cause also move BB-tracks. Dragging in the middle moves the track.
It makes good sense that BB-tracks can be expanded with repetitive content. That will often be what you want in a project. As explained in the section above, instruments that are defined in the BB-editor, can behave just like percussion-patterns, but use this feature with care.
Do remember to name your BB-tracks and to allocate FX-channels for the sound-generators!

== Instrument Tracks ==
Needless to say, this is where your creativity is the crucial factor. Good insight in chords and chord-progressions will greatly aid you in the composing of your song. There 100ths’ of pages on the net on the subject. If we keep focus on the LMMS specifics, then there are a few acts that could be considered as ‘best-practice’.
* Name all instruments
When you load a factory-instrument or a blank default-preset, the name will be ‘Default-preset’. Don’t omit to name you instrument. Next month when you reopen your project and see 20+ ‘Default-presets’ you are so lost. And only you have the blame..
I recommend that you use the disk-file-name for factory-presets. If you make changes to the instrument, save it to a different folder with a new name.
* Allocate a FX-channel
The FX-channels refers to the mixer. Each channel or ‘Bus’ is handled separately and you will get better dynamic in your music if only one mixer channel is used for one instrument. This goes for the percussion as well!
LMMS has 64 channels, and you may like to use each 16-slot family for a different purpose. You could have ordinary instrument in slot A, Effects in slot B and percussion in slot C, but that’s just a suggestion. You should rename each mixer-channel with its instrument name.
