= Getting Started with LMMS =

== Your First Song ==
 
LMMS is a tool that can be used to make music effectivly without very much hassle.  To showcase this fact, if you follow these step by step instructions you should be able to make your own songs very quickly.  

If you are using Windows, double click the icon on your desktop or go start menu - programs - LMMS to load your version of the LMMS program.  ( I am not aware of anything different in the linux version so I am afraid I can't help here.)

When you first load the program you will see several boxes with various titles and a toolbar at the top left.  Looking at the upper to middle left side of the screen you will also see some small icons.  These are important as most of these are where you sellect your sounds.  

For our first sound we are going to select the small box on the left side with the music note.  This box is your sample collection that comes standard with LMMS.  When you Click the My Samples box a list of folders should appear, one of them labeled "drums".  Double clicking the box will show a list of percussion instruments.  Click on them to hear the different sounds of the instruments.  

If you look at the open boxes one of them should read "Beat and Bassline Editor.  Locate that box before going forward.  If you have closed it by chance it is located on the left top toolbar.  

Going back to the cool samples you just heard select the bassdrum_acoustic02.ogg, click that file and drag it to the beat editor and a new tab should appear in box with that same label.  do the same thing to the instruments hihat_closed04.ogg and snare02.ogg (scroll down).  

If it is done correctly you should have 3 instruments in the beat and bassline editor box (from here this editor will be called bnb box).  Push the play button located on the bnb box.  you should hear silence.  if you press on the small tombstone like icon on the bassdrums instrument line you should eventualy hear the drum with a flash from the the instruments sounding bar (it only lights up when it is being played.) For this part 0 will mean that the instrument bar is left blank.  1 will mean that the instrument bar is active.

Your first Bassdrum line will be 1 0 0 0 | 0 0 1 0 | 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0.

Your first HiHat line will be 1 0 0 0 | 1 0 0 0 | 1 0 0 0 | 1 0 0 0.

Your first Snare line will be 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 | 1 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0.

When done correctly this will make a simple drum beat.  We have the beat now we need the melody.  (you can push stop now) 

In the next section we will cover why you should have stuck with those piano lessons.

== Your First Melody ==
  





== The Interface ==
Disclaimer: the interface may vary slightly based on which version is installed. 

The LMMS interface can be broken down into parts: the [[Main Menu Bar]] at the very top, the [[Tool Bar]] directly below the Main Menu Bar, and the [[Side Bar]] at the far left.  The largest portion of the interface is occupied by some windows which are used to actually create and edit the music.

The Main Menu Bar is what you might expect from any other program. It has a few options dealing with project files, undoing and redoing actions to the current project, accessing some plugins, and accessing online help, if necessary.  

The Tool Bar, below the menu bar, has the same buttons for dealing with the project files - make new, open, save, and export. The second row of buttons on the Tool Bar are used to show/hide windows in the main section of the interface. The right side of the Tool Bar contains some of the master controls for the song. They include tempo, time signature, volume, pitch, and a master-output visualization pane.

The Side Bar, to the far left of the interface, is a set of tab buttons. They can be clicked to display the tab's contents, and then clicked a second time to hide it.  The items in the Side Bar will be explained as necessary, but for now, the items include Instrument plugins, My projects, My samples, My presets, My home, and My computer.

The main part of the interface contains a number of windows.

Upon launch of LMMS, there will always be a few windows opened. The four windows opened by default are the [[0.4:Song Editor|Song-Editor]], the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat+Bassline Editor]], [[0.4:FX Mixer|FX-Mixer]], and the [[0.4:Controller Rack|Controller Rack]]

Before you are ready to jump right in, one thing must be emphasized: Save often!  Save your project every time you have done something that sounds good. It is also a good strategy to save different versions of the song.  This will allow you to 'roll-back'  to a previous version of the project.  

The first time you save a project you will be prompted for a folder and a project-name. Subsequent saves will overwrite this file, and LMMS will show you a small success message in the bottom of the screen. Wait for this message!

==Jumping Right In==

A project is made by adding sound generators (sidebar tab 1), existing presets (sidebar tab 4) and samples (sidebar tab 3) to either the song-editor or the Beat-and bass-editor. The song editor is useful for non-repeating sound events, such as melody lines, and the Beat-and bass-editor is useful for repeating sounds, like percussion.

Events created in the Beat-and bass-editor are 'continuous' -i.e. they can be expanded by mouse-dragging as long as you would like.

Events created in the Song-editor are 'atomic' -i.e. they can't be expanded (but can be copied, of course).

The actual song is always built in the song-editor. This is where all the blocks, including events in the Beat-and bass-editor, come together on the timeline, and reveal your complete composition.

Lets take a look at the default Song-editor.
In the default Song-editor there are 4 items loaded. The first one, named'Default Preset',is an instance of the Triple OSC (3OSC) generator, as an example of an instrument-container. This instance is without any preset-settings and will only beep a simple sine sound. It could actually be deleted, but before we do that, we should look at it, because it has behavior that is the same for all other instrument-containers.
When you move your mouse over the instrument-containers, they will high-light. This indicates that the instruments can be clicked as if they were buttons! Left-click the Triple OSC. This opens the instrument GUI. Click again, and the GUI is closed. All instruments behave like this. 

When you make changes on the GUI you create a Preset. If it sounds less than horrible, you have an instrument :)
If you right-click you will have a rename option. Always name your instruments!

To the left of the instruments there are 2 clickable 'lamps'. When the green lamp is ON, the track is activated. In its OFF state the track is muted.
The other lamp is red. When the red lamp is ON, the track will mute all other tracks, and play solo.

Next, to the left of these, we have the action-button. Here you can delete or clone the track and all of its events.

To the right of the instruments, before the knobs, we have a vertical bar. When clicked it will play the root-note of the instrument. We also have a knob for volume and one for balance. 
On the right half of the song-editor, we have the timeline. Create a track by adding events to this timeline.
The timeline is divided in bar-sized blocks. Click in one next to 3OSC. You get a black box. If you double-click the black box, you open the Piano-Roll editor. This is where you create your tune.
We will return to that later.

Below the 3OSC you have the Sample-Track. Its purpose is mostly vocals or other larger wave or ogg files that you want to replay un-altered. You can add a new sampletrack with the 6. button on the song-editor speed-bar.

Next you have the default Beat-and-Bassline instance. Just for illustration, click on one of the boxes in the timeline next to the Beat/bassline track. You get a blue block. Click and drag its right end, and it will expand. This is what I meant by Beat-and Bassline events are 'continuous'. When you did that the with the 3OSC, the block was black, and would not expand.
You can add a new Beat-and-Bassline with the 5. button on the song-editor speed-bar.

Last is an instance of the Automation-Track. This can give you advanced variations in real-time, like filter-envelope effects. How to use this track is explained in [[0.4:Working with Automation|Working with Automation]].
You can add a new Automation-Track with the 7. button on the song-editor speed-bar, at the top of the song editor window.

But a project needs more than a default 3OSC, and luckily LMMS comes with an abundance of great instruments. 

== Your instruments: Presets & Samples ==
Now we take a look at those components that creates sounds. The Instruments and Samples.
To insert one of the many factory pre-defined instruments (also called plugin-[[0.4:Side Bar#Presets|Presets]]) into the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] or [[0.4:Song Editor|Song Editor]], click the yellow star (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/sidebar-retracted-preset.png) in the Side-Bar, that works just like a browser.
Everything that you can do in the Side-bar-browser with instruments, you can also do with Samples, the Side-bars 3. button opens the MySamples collection.  
In the browser, you can click and hold your mouse on the name of an instrument preset. LMMS will then let you listen to that particular instrument, as a kind of sound-test. You can then drag the instruments into the editor. You can also double click a preset-name in the browser. This place the object directly into the Beat + Bassline Editor, or you can right-click on the instrument in the browser-list-tree, and LMMS will open a context-menu. Here you have the option to send this instrument into an empty slot in the song-editor or to replace a current active instrument with this new instrument. The 'Active Instrument' is the instrument that is highlighted in the song-editor, and has its GUI opened -In other words: Has been mouse-clicked. Use the send-to-active-instrument option if you need to load a VSTige instrument. (More on this: [[04: How to use VSTige Instruments]].

When you insert an instrument, the instrument's GUI editor window will open. You can also see this GUI by clicking on the instruments grey 'name' button in the Song or Beat + Bassline editors. When you click the 'name' button the button will change to lightgray. This instrument is now the 'Active Instrument'. The 'name' button acts as a toggle for the GUI editor window. Instrument GUI's have five tabs: PLUGIN, ENV/LFO FUNC, FX and MIDI.  The 'PLUGIN' tab changes with the type of instrument; all other tabs are standard for every instrument, however nothing on the ENV/LFO tab will influence VSTige plug-ins.
The in and outs of how to use the features on the various tabs, are described in the [[0.4:Working with Instruments|Working with Instruments]] section.

If you want to remove an instrument completely from your song, click on its gray 'toolkit' icon and choose 'Remove this track'.

Instruments are divided into factory provided and user specified, and subfolders in your file system can be used to organize the instruments or samples hierarchically.

Later you may like to create your own instruments from scratch. The sidebar's 1. button opens the Instrument-Plugins. These are empty default preset-templates that you can use for your own instruments. Drag them into your project and play around with all the settings on the GUI.
Some hints and tips on how to create 3OC instruments can be found in [[0.4:Making Triple-Oscillator Patches|Making Triple-Oscillator Patches]].
(You can of course also make changes to the factory-defined instruments and save those as your own. Overwriting existing factory-defined instruments is not recommended). 

== Creating a Track ==

The standard way to create a track is to add drum instruments to the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] and instruments for melody tracks into the [[Song Editor]].  Then create different drum loops using the '''Add bassline''' button in the Beat + Bassline Editor for each rhythm you want - a main bass line, a hihat line, special rhythms and breaks, etc.  These are listed in the Song Editor as they're created.  To make them sound, click on the start bar in the track's timeline to create a new segment.  You can also drag in Beat-and-Bassline blocks to make the pattern go across multiple bars. The same technique can be used for repetitive bass lines if you create them in the Beat-and-Bassline-editor.

[[File:keyboard-pianoKeys1.png|400px|thumb|right|keyboard as piano]]
For melody tracks, click in the song-editor on the bar where you want a new melodi-segment and then double-click that segment to open the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor|Piano Roll Editor]].  Place notes in the piano roll by clicking on their start quanta line (to create them) and then dragging their right-hand edge to be as long or short as you want.  You can also drag notes up and down the scale and forward and backwards in time to position them correctly.  Alternatively, you can press the 'record' button in the Piano Roll Editor and play notes in real time, either on the keyboard where the keyboard key 'Z' will play a C note, S plays a C#, X plays D, and D on your keyboard will play D# (see the picture right). To play notes one octave higher we move to key Q to play C, etc.) LMMS can also be used with a MIDI keyboard. A list of successfully installed keyboards is under development. Yamaha PSR 500m, Yamaha E413 keyboard. Midistart 3 pro keys USB keyboard by miditech, and Korg Nano, have been reported to work in the forum. -But hardware and OS differences are not unimportant!
Ask in the instrument-store if you can test the keyboard you want to purchase, and do get a keyboard with regular piano sized keys. In the long run you will apreciate that choice.

Before you continue the section on drum-patterns I would recommend that you now read and do the excise in the section 
[[0.4:Your First Song with LMMS|Your First Song with LMMS]]
That helped me a lot when I started on LMMS.

('''figure.1''') ('''example''')

<pre>step....         1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16 
Bass drum      | X - / - / - / | X - / - / - / | X - / - / - / | X - / - / - / |

</pre>

X=note on ;
/=silence

above in (Figure.1) we have a simple 4 beat pattern using 16ths or 16 segments within our pattern. You can see from "Bass drum" that there is an X (note on) at 1,5,9,13, ,this gives us the typical beat used in most techno/trance or house style music. Next is the snare drum at 5, and 13, which gives us a swing type feel to the rhythm. And finally the open and closed hi-hats to compliment the rhythm.
 
now that you have the general idea these patterns can be applied to your songs in LMMS using the "beat + bassline editor" (which uses the 16ths/16 steps to 1 bar or 4 beats).


below are some examples for you to try out and perhaps use in your songs.

('''1''') '''Amen Break''' - [this was a drum solo originally performed by Gregory Sylvester Coleman, but has been heavily sampled and pitched up for use in drum and bass and jungle styles]
