{{0.4:Working with Effects and the MixerTrans}}

= Direct Effects vs FX-mixer =

You have 2 choices in how to add effects to an instrument:
* Direct Effects are added directly to an instrument in its instrument settings window without using an FX-channel. See this section of the Instrument Editor about [[0.4:Instrument Editor#The_FX_tab|the FX tab]].
* The FX-Mixer allows you to add 1 or more instruments to an FX-channel and then add the effects to the FX-channel. See this page about [[0.4:FX Mixer|the FX-Mixer]].
