The Guide to Music, a 28-page .pdf file, includes information on everything from the basics of counting music to writing basic music in the program Linux Multi-Media Studio. It is free for use at multiple locations and can be downloaded. Although the guidebook is long in length, it is, according to it's author, Samulis, not finished.
