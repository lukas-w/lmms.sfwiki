Classification of steel scaffolding Introduction 

Now all the Chinese steel materials used in the <b>[http://www.iscaffold.com.cn scaffolding]</b> with a steel tubular scaffolding, bowl button steel scaffolding, socket-type pipe scaffolding, gantry scaffolding, there are a variety of in scaffolding, scaffolding and other steel hanging pick material scaffolding. Circumstances of its material and construction to proceed, and can be roughly divided as follows: Materials are classified according Bars 

1) a single standard steel scaffolding. It only uses a standard steel pipe, such as steel tubular scaffolding, only Ф48 × 3.5 welded pipes. 

2) The combination of multiple specifications of steel scaffolding. It consists of two or more different specifications of the steel composition, such as gantry scaffolding. 

3) Pipe-based scaffolding. That is mainly steel, and combined with other type of steel pieces composed of scaffolding, such as the channel has a base in the backwater or scaffolding, the challenges are connected steel scaffolding and so on. 

When the button steel bowl with steel bar while scaffolding for a "single pipe scaffolding"; When using the steel bar at take the side for the "steel-based scaffolding". By passing between the bar and the Pole by method of vertical force 

1) by the friction force transfer contact surface. By the node that is pressed after the contact surface of the friction reaction force to support and pass the bar load pole, such as the role of fasteners, bolts through the positive pressure on the friction force; 

2) Transmission by the weld. Most of the bar and the pole of the socket connection is to use this approach, the door frame also belong in this way; 

3) direct pressure force transmission. In this way more common in the top bar in shelving in the pole scaffolding; 

4) The shear force transfer lever by pin. The bar through the bar with a vertical pin link plates and the holes to achieve coupling pole, double pole off by shear force. This method of connection in the bar and the pole has been rare.
