Here are a few pointers to guide you in making good artwork the right way.

== Naming Artwork ==
* Keep it short. Long file names suck.
* Avoid spaces and capitals. Linux doesn't really like spaces in names, and capitals complicate things. If you have to, use _ for spaces.
* Think of something catchy. People will remember it better.

== Formats ==
* Try to work with SVG files for icons. You can later export them in all shapes and sizes.
* PNG is best for icons and computer graphics, JPG is better for pictures.
