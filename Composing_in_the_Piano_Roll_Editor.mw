= Writing Notes =

== By mouse ==

The standard tool for editing notes in the Piano Roll Editor is the pencil tool (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-editing-pencil.png).  With this you can create, move, resize and delete notes.

To '''create''' a note, simply click inside the piano roll grid.  The horizontal dark grey will show you which note on the keyboard you are going to be creating, and when you click the instrument will play that note as an aural cue.

The length of the note created is set by the note length control (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-notelen-last.png).  By default this is set to use the length of the last note created or edited.  This is often convenient when creating many notes of the same length.  Alternatively, you can select from a list of standard note lengths, expressed in fractions of a beat.

To '''move''' a note, drag any part of the note (except the end).  You can drag it vertically to change pitch, horizontally to change its start time, or both.

To '''resize''' a note, drag the end of the note.  This simply changes its end 'cut-off' point while keeping the note starting at its original point in time.  You cannot change the start time while keeping the note end at its original point in time - to do this you should move the note to its new start time and then resize it to the desired length.

There are two ways of easily creating a much longer note in a series of short ones (or vice versa) and using the 'last note' length setting above.  One is to create all the notes of one length first at their correct points in time, and then go back and fill in the longer notes; resizing the first longer note will then set the length.  The other way is to create the longer note as a short note, resize it, and then grab the resize handle of a shorter note and resize it to its original length (e.g. move it one quanta shorter and then back).

To '''delete''' a note, right-click on it.  You can also use the eraser tool (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-editing-eraser.png) - when using this, simply left-click on any note to delete it.

The start time of a note is '''quantised''' to the fraction of a beat shown in the quantisation selector (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-quantise-16.png).  This controls both where a note starts and its length - both have to be multiples of the quantisation setting.  It does not affect notes that are already created whose property you are not changing - for instance, with quantisation set to 1/32, you can position a note on an odd 32nd (i.e. not on a vertical 1/16th step line); then, with quantisation set to 1/16, you can resize that note and its end point will be forced to be on an even 32nd without changing the start point.  In this example the note would always be an odd number of 32nds in length.

== By keyboard ==

You can also '''record''' yourself playing the notes either on a MIDI keyboard or on the computer's keyboard (see the picture right) using the record button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-playback-record.png).  When recording, you will hear a 'click' sound every beat to help you stay in sync with the time signature.  It can also be useful to set the quantisation to the minimum your piece requires; so even if you play a little early or late, the note will be placed in the piano roll at the correct time.  You may still have to go through and edit the notes (as above) to make sure they're positioned correctly and to remove mistakes.

LMMS also give you the option to record in ‘playing along mode’. For this type of recording you use the record-button with the black center. LMMS will play the existing notes on piano-roll and allow you to play notes simultaneously. The notes you play will be recorded.

Once you have finished recording that section, press the '''stop''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/icons-stop.png) or the space bar to stop recording.

= Editing Notes =

One of the features in normal music is that there are minute variations. This is because the music is performed by a human artist. In computer generated music the quality is not present, but LMMS offer a method to achieve it.
Just below the editor area in the piano-roll, you will find a section with vertical bars. One bar for each note in the piano-roll. Each bar represent one notes volume. 
There are 2 different ways to adjust the volume. Rest your mouse over a note and scroll the mouse-wheel. The color-brightness change. The dimmer the lower.
Of cause you also adjust each bar with your mouse and also drag the mouse along creating a wavy pattern. Especially percussion tracks can be improved with fine adjustments of the loudness.


== Copy and paste ==

When you compose you will often find the need for duplicating a selected section or all the notes in the piano-roll. LMMS offers several ways to achieve this.
All notes can be standard selected with CTRL+a
Selections can be made by:
* using the select-tool
* using keyboard-shortcuts
The select-tool in the speedbar works like a standard ‘rubber-frame’. The notes you touch with the frame will be selected. This is ok, but you will most often just like to use the keyboard-short CTRL+mouse-drag. This nifty method lets you select just as if you used the select-tool.
Releasing CTRL will put LMMS editor back to the default draw-mode.
Selected notes can be smart-copied: Rest your mouse on one of the selected notes. Hold SHIFT and drag the mouse to the wanted position. When you release the mouse, you will have a copy of your selected notes.
