Kicker is a kick- and bassdrum synthesizer. It works by starting with a triangle wave at a certain frequency and gradually changing it to another frequency.

*'''Start:''' Start frequency
*'''End:''' End frequency
*'''Decay:''' Time it takes to get from start frequency to end frequency
*'''Dist:''' Distortion added to the output
*'''Gain:''' Additional gain added to the output (makes it louder)

Kicker ignores the pitch of the note it plays. Thus it is best used in the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat/Bassline]].

To get sounds which actually sound like drums you should set "Start" to a low level and "End" even lower. "Decay" should also be quite low. <!-- Maybe someone has some other ways this plugin can be used? -->
