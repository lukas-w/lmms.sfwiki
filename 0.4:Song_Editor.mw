{{0.4:Song EditorTrans}}

The Song Editor displays the structure of the song.

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/9/9c/Song-editor.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

* The left side of the window displays the instrument and beat/bassline tracks.
* The right side of the window displays the activity of each track at each bar in the song.
* The scroll bars at the right and bottom of the window allow you to move the segment view around. Use Shift+mouse-wheel to scroll horizontally.

= Working with Elements =

Anatomy of a track:

Each track's activity is divided into '''elements'''. <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/51/Pattern-pianoroll.png
For '''Instrument Tracks''', the display is a miniature piano roll. <br> 
Double-clicking on it will open the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor|Piano Roll Editor]] window where you can add, delete, or modify individual notes.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/ed/Pattern-sampletrack.png
For '''Sample Tracks''', the display is a miniature waveform of the sample. <br> 
Double-clicking on it will open a File-Open dialog where you can choose a new sample for that element.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3d/Pattern-beatbassline.png
For '''Beat/Bassline Tracks''', the display is simply a blue block showing that the beat/bassline is active. <br>
Double-clicking on it will open the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] window where you can add, delete, or modify individual notes (beats).

To '''create a new element''', left-click in the track activity area within the bar where you want the block to start. <br> 
For instrument and sample tracks, this creates a blank area where you can put notes or samples. <br> 
For beat/bassline tracks, this creates 1 (or more) bars filled with that particular Beat/Bassline as configured.

To '''move an element''', drag it by clicking and holding the block. <br> 
As it's dragged, the block will snap to the start of any bar, but you can free drag (with a 1/64th resolution) by holding down the Ctrl key '''''after''''' you begin dragging (Ctrl+drag before you begin dragging initiates the "copy" procedure).

To '''copy an element''', hold the Ctrl key down '''''before''''' you begin dragging and then drag the copy to its new location. <br> 
You can also right-click on the block, select ''copy'', left-click to create an empty block where you want the copy to go, right-click and select ''paste''. <br> 
You can't copy blocks of one track type to tracks of a different type. <br> 
To copy again, the control key has to be released and re-pressed before the next drag operation.

To '''delete an element''', click it using the middle mouse button or right-click on it and select ''delete''. <br> 
Double-clicking on a block means to '''edit the element's contents'''. 


== Editing Tools ==

=== Draw Mode Tool ===

Despite their different content, the ways of working with elements are mostly similar. <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/e1/Button-pencil.png 
Most of the work in the Song-Editor is done using the '''Draw Mode''' tool.

=== Edit Mode Tool ===

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/bb/Button-movetool.png
The '''Edit Mode''' tool allows you to select a rectangular region of blocks in the tracks and move them as a group. 

=== Bar Insert & Delete===

'''Shift+Insert-key''' inserts a new, empty bar to the right of the playhead's current position into all the tracks. Much like inserting a word into a sentence using a word processor. <br> 
'''Shift+Delete-key''' deletes a bar to the right of the playhead's current position from all the tracks. Much like deleting a word in a sentence using a word processor; '''''however''''', the rules it follows are a bit strange:
* For each track, if there's an empty bar to the right of the playhead, that bar is deleted which moves all the downstream blocks in that track left by 1 bar.
* For each track, if there's an occupied bar (i.e. a block is present) to the right of the playhead, the bar to the '''''left''''' of the playhead is deleted (whether occupied or not), which moves all the blocks to the right of the playhead in that track to the left by 1 bar. An exception to this rule occurs if the playhead is at the beginning of the song (i.e. bar #1 is the bar to the right of the playhead). In this case:
** if the bar to the right contains the last block in the track, nothing happens.
** if the bar to the right does not contain the last block in the track, the bar to the right is deleted which moves all the remaining blocks in that track to the left by 1 bar.
<br>

= Song Editor Toolbar =

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b1/Song-editor-toolbar.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The Song Editor window has a toolbar that allows you to control playback of the song, add new tracks, choose edit tools, customise the method of playback, and control the view of the song.


== Playback Controls ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/2/23/Button-play.png
The '''Play''' button (or keyboard spacebar) starts playback at the current playhead position. 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b4/Button-pause.png 
During playback, the '''Pause''' button icon replaces the Play button icon. It will pause playback and leave the playhead at its current position. Strangely, during a pause, the Pause button icon should change back to the Play button icon, but it doesn't. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/2/2d/Button-stop.png
The '''Stop''' button (or keyboard spacebar) stops playback (or a paused playback), and returns the playhead to the location defined by the Return Mode button (see below).

The '''Return Mode''' button is a 3-position toggle that controls where the playhead moves when you halt playback using the Stop button. 
There are 3 modes: <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3c/Button-settings.png
'''To Start''' (the default mode): the playhead returns to the start of the song (bar #1). <br>
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-toolbar-playcontrol-return-tobefore.png
'''To Before''' : the playhead returns to the position where this playback started. <br>
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-toolbar-playcontrol-return-cont.png
'''Continue''' : the playhead remains where it was stopped (i.e. it doesn't move). <br>

Between the '''Play''' button and the '''Stop''' button there are two other buttons: 
* "Record samples from Audio-device" 
* "Record samples from Audio-device while playing song or BB track"

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/e1/Button-autoscroll.png
The '''Auto-scroll''' button is on by default. <br> 
During playback, the view in the Song-Editor window will automatically scroll horizontally to display the current playhead position. <br> 
As the playhead moves past the right edge of the window, the window will scroll horizontally so the playhead continues at the left edge. <br> 
With Auto-scroll off, the playhead can disappear during playback. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/af/Button-looppoints.png
The '''Enable Loop-points''' button is off (disabled) by default. <br> 
When turned on, the loop-point icons become active (bright green) on the timeline. You can drag the loop-points along the timeline as follows:
* end loop-point: Right-mouse-button+drag
* start loop-point: Middle-mouse-button+drag
By default the loop-points are "magnetic" which means that, as you drag them, they snap to the nearest bar boundary; however, you can hold down the Ctrl key as you drag to position them with more precision.
During Song-Editor playback, the playhead will loop continuously between the start and end loop-points. <br> 
This is useful for testing a particular section of your piece, but it only exists in playback mode. It is not a way to repeat a section a certain number of times within your composition--you'll have to use copy/paste for that. <br>

== Adding Tracks ==

There is no button for adding a new instrument track. You add a new instrument track by dragging the desired plugin or preset from the [[0.4:Side Bar|Side Bar]] to an empty area in the Song-Editor. Next, click on the instrument track's name to show/hide the [[0.4:Instrument Editor|Instrument Editor]] window for that [[Plugins|plugin]]. This window is where you can make changes to the sound of the instrument.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/70/Button-addbeatbassline.png
To add a new Beat/Bassline track, click the '''Add beat/bassline''' button. <br> 
Right-click on the beat/bassline track's name to rename it to something more identifiable.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/c/c8/Button-addsampletrack.png
To add a new sample track, click the '''Add sample-track''' button.

== Zoom Control ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/a3/Zoomsection.png 
The final control is the '''Zoom''' control. <br> 
Setting this allows you to control how much detail is shown in the view of the track segments. <br> 
The larger this is, the more detail you see; the smaller it is, the more of the song you see in the view. <br> 
You can also hold down '''ctrl''' and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Resizing tracks:

By holding down the '''shift''' key and dragging in a track, you can resize the height of a track. <br> 
This can be very useful for sample tracks when you need to see more precision in the sample.

= Track Settings Bar =

To the left of the track's activity is a set of buttons and controls that allow you to work with the track as a whole. <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/f/fa/Trackbar4-automation.png

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/35/Grabbar.png
The grey stippled area immediately at the left of the track is the '''grab bar'''. <br> 
This allows you to grab the track and drag it up and down in the order of tracks. <br> 
You can also easily make a copy of an entire track by holding down ''Ctrl'' while dragging the grip. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/d/d3/Button-tracksettings.png
Next appears the '''track tools menu''' icon. This displays a drop-down menu with two options: '''clone track''' and '''remove track'''. <br> 
Cloning a track makes an exact copy of the track and its contents and pastes them at the bottom of the track list. <br> 
Hopefully it won't be necessary to explain what removing a track does. :-)

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/8/89/Button-solomute.png
After this is the '''mute control'''.  This allows you to turn off the sound of this track temporarily. <br> 
This is useful, for example, when you want to hear the sound of an accompanying instrument without the lead instrument. <br> 
Right clicking on the track gives you the option to [[0.4:Working with Automation|automate]] the muting process on the track, although this is strongly discouraged in preference to automating the volume control. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/53/Trackbar-name.png

The rest of the track settings displays the '''sound source''' information. <br> 
This varies between instrument tracks, sample tracks and beat/bassline tracks.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/71/Trackbar1-instrument.png <br> 
For '''instrument tracks''' you get a volume and a pan control (also automatable). <br>
A drop-down menu to select the track's midi inputs and outputs (in track tools menu). <br>
and the button that displays the instrument's plugin and preset name. <br> 
Clicking on it opens the actual instrument editor. <br> 
Right-clicking opens a dialog to rename that track. <br> 
At the far right of the sound source there is an "activity bar" which lights up when the instrument is actually playing.
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-settings-activity-off.png <br> 
You can also click on it to preview the sound.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b5/Trackbar2-sample.png <br> 
For '''sample tracks''' you get also a volume control (likewise also automatable). <br> 
Clicking on the track name button allows you to set up [[LADSPA|effects]] on the sample track. <br> 
Right-clicking opens a dialog to rename that track.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/64/Trackbar3-beatbassline.png <br> 
For '''beat/bassline tracks''', you get a graphic displaying the content of the pattern. <br> 
Clicking on it opens the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]], if it's not already open. <br> 
Right-clicking opens a dialog to rename that track.

= Track Context Menu =

The track context menu appears when you right-click on an element of a track's activity.  The options presented depend on which type of track it is.

== Instrument Tracks ==

The instrument track context menu looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b3/Contextmenu-pianoroll.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

This gives you the most options of all the song editor context menus.

'''Open in piano-roll''' opens the clicked-on segment in the [[Piano Roll Editor]] (strangely enough).

'''Delete''' deletes the clicked-on segment.

'''Cut''' removes the clicked-on segment and puts it in the clipboard.

'''Copy''' takes a copy of the clicked-on segment and puts it in the clipboard.

'''Paste''' pastes the contents of the clipboard into this segment, overwriting its previous contents.

'''Mute/Unmute''' allows you to turn sound off or on for this track while editing it. 
This does not affect the set volume of the track, but acts like the 'mute' button on a mixing desk.

'''Clear all notes''' allows you to erase the contents of the clicked-on segment without deleting the segment itself. <br> 
Normally the name of the instrument is given to the segment. <br> 
This is copied and pasted with the contents of the segment, so you can see the original source of this segment. <br> 

'''Reset name''' allows you to reset that name to the name of the instrument plugin of the track, and '''Change name''' allows you to edit it manually.

'''Freeze''' allows you to [[Glossary#F|freeze]] the sound of this track by creating a pre-rendered sample of the track alone. <br> 
This cuts down on the workload of rendering this track, which may be useful on low-powered systems or tracks with complex effects and melodies. <br> 
You can edit the track's contents while the track is frozen, but the edits do not take effect until it is thawed or refrozen. <br> 

'''Add steps''' and '''Remove Steps''' allow you to add or remove a number steps (equal to a 16th note) selected from a submenu to the end of a pattern. <br> 
This is similar to the same option in the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] but seems to have little purpose here.

== Sample Tracks ==

The sample track context menu looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/71/Contextmenu-sampletrack.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The actions of each option are essentially the same as those for the instrument track above.

== Beat/Bassline Tracks ==

The beat/bassline track context menu looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/66/Contextmenu-bb-editor.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The actions of each option are essentially the same as those for the instrument track above.  The only addition is:

'''Change color''' allows you to change the colour of the bassline track. <br> 
This allows you to coordinate the function or content of the tracks by their colour, <br>
allowing you to quickly work out which bassline in a complex rhythm section you are dealing with.
