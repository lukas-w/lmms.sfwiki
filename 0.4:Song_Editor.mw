{{0.4:Song EditorTrans}}

The Song Editor displays the structure of the song.

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/9/9c/Song-editor.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

Down the left-hand side of the window are listed the instrument and beat/bassline tracks available; <br>
on the right of these is listed the activity of each track at each bar in the song. <br> 
The scroll bars at the right and bottom of the window allow you to move the segment view around. <br> 
You can also hold down '''shift''' and use the mouse wheel to scroll horizontally.

= Working with Elements =

Anatomy of a track:

Each track's activity is divided into '''elements'''. <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/51/Pattern-pianoroll.png
For '''instrument tracks''', these display a miniature piano roll. <br> 
Double-clicking on it, the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor|Piano Roll Editor]] window will open and the notes in that element will be displayed for editing. 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/ed/Pattern-sampletrack.png
For '''sample tracks''' it displays a miniature wave display of the sample. <br> 
Double-clicking on it, a file open dialog will display allowing you to choose a new sample for that element.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3d/Pattern-beatbassline.png
For '''beat + basslines''' this is simply a block showing that the beat/bassline is active.
It displayes a filled (shaded) coloured bar for the length of the beat or bassline. <br>
Double-clicking on it, the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] window will open and that beat/bassline will be displayed.

To '''create a new element''', simply left-click on the track activity inside the bar in which you want the segment to start. <br> 
For instrument and sample tracks, this creates a blank area to put notes or samples in. <br> 
For beat/bassline tracks, this creates one bar filled with the beat/bassline as programmed.

To '''move an element''', simply drag it around by clicking and holding anywhere inside the segment. <br> 
Normally this will lock to the start of the bar, but you can free drag (with a 1/64th resolution) the segment by pressing the ''control'' key down ''once you have started dragging''.

To '''copy an element''', simply hold the ''control'' key down ''before you click'' and then drag the segment to its copies' new location. <br> 
You can also right-click on the segment, choose ''copy'' from the context menu, <br> 
click to create a new sample where you want the copy to go, right click and choose ''paste'' from the menu. <br> 
You can't copy segments of one type to tracks of another type, however. <br> 
To copy more than once, the control key has to be released and re-pressed before the next drag operation.

To '''delete an element''', click on it using the middle mouse button or right-click on it and choose 'delete' from the context menu. <br> 
Double-clicking on an element aims to '''edit the element's contents'''. 


== Editing Tools ==

=== Edit Tool ===

Despite their different content, the ways of working with elements are mostly similar. <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/e1/Button-pencil.png 
Most of the work with in the song editor is done using the '''edit tool'''.

=== Move Tool ===

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/bb/Button-movetool.png
The '''move tool''' allows you to select a rectangular region of the segments in the tracks and move them as a group.

In addition, you can use '''Shift-Insert''' and '''Shift-Delete''' to move all the elements to the right of the playhead in the song forward or backward one bar at a time. <br> 
Effectively, Shift-Insert inserts a new bar to the right of the playhead in the song, and Shift-Delete removes a bar, again right to the playhead. <br> Elements that are already at the first bar will not move but other later segments will still move to the left. <br> 
However - even though you use the key 'Delete' on your keyboard, you do not delete anything! <br> 
Elements will stack as they move to the left.

= Song Editor Toolbar =

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b1/Song-editor-toolbar.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The Song Editor window has a toolbar that allows you to control playback of the song, add new tracks, choose edit tools, customise the method of playback, and control the view of the song.


== Playback Buttons ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/2/23/Button-play.png
The '''Play''' button starts playback at the current cursor point. 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/2/2d/Button-stop.png
The '''Stop''' button stops playback if it has been started <br> 
It moves the cursor depending on what mode you have chosen in the play control tool (see below).

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b4/Button-pause.png 
While the song is playing, you can use the '''Pause''' button to halt playback without moving the cursor. <br> 

Between the '''Play''' button and the '''Stop''' button there are two other buttons: 
* "Record samples from Audio-device" 
* "Record samples from Audio-device while playing song or BB track"


== Playback Controls ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/e/e1/Button-autoscroll.png
The '''Autoscroll''' button is normally turned on. <br> 
During playback, the view in the song editor will automatically move to include the current playback point. <br> 
If it moves off the right hand edge of the window, the window will be repositioned so it is at the left hand edge. <br> 

If the autoscroll button is turned off, then the window position will not follow the playback point during playback. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/af/Button-looppoints.png
The '''Loop''' button is normally turned off. <br> 

When turned on, the loop points are turned on and playback will loop continuously between the start and end loop points. <br> 
This can be useful when testing a particular section of your piece, but it only exists as a playback mode, not as a way to repeat a section a certain number of times. <br> 

* The '''Return''' button controls the way the playback position moves after you halt playback using the stop button. 
There are three modes: <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3c/Button-settings.png
'''To Start''' - by default, the playback position will return to the start of the song.

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-toolbar-playcontrol-return-tobefore.png
'''To Before''' - when in this mode, the playback position will return to the position that it previously started from. <br> 
This will usually be where you last placed the playback position. <br> 

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-toolbar-playcontrol-return-cont.png
'''Continue''' - in this mode, the playback position will not be moved and playback will commence from where it is stopped.


== Adding Tracks ==

You can add new instrument tracks to the song editor by dragging them from the [[0.4:Side Bar|Side Bar]]. <br> 
The instrument's [[Plugins|plugin]] will be displayed, allowing you to make any changes you need to the sound of the instrument. <br> 
You can dispel this plugin display by using its close button or by clicking on the instrument name button in the song editor.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/70/Button-addbeatbassline.png
To add a new beat or bassline track, click the '''add beat/bassline''' button. <br> 
You can right-click on the name of the beat/bassline in order to rename it to something more identifiable.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/c/c8/Button-addsampletrack.png
To add a new sample track, click the '''add sample-track''' button.

Note that there is no button allowing you to add a new instrument track. <br> 
This is because you would have to select a plugin for the instrument before the track was created, <br>
and this is far easier to do by trading the correct plugin or preset from the [[0.4:Side Bar|Side Bar]].


== Zoom Control ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/a3/Zoomsection.png 
The final control is the '''Zoom''' control. <br> 
Setting this allows you to control how much detail is shown in the view of the track segments. <br> 
The larger this is, the more detail you see; the smaller it is, the more of the song you see in the view. <br> 
You can also hold down '''ctrl''' and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Resizing tracks:

By holding down the '''shift''' key and dragging in a track, you can resize the height of a track. <br> 
This can be very useful for sample tracks when you need to see more precision in the sample.


= Track Settings Bar =

To the left of the track's activity is a set of buttons and controls that allow you to work with the track as a whole. <br> 
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/f/fa/Trackbar4-automation.png

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/35/Grabbar.png
The grey stippled area immediately at the left of the track is the '''grab bar'''. <br> 
This allows you to grab the track and drag it up and down in the order of tracks. <br> 
You can also easily make a copy of an entire track by holding down ''Ctrl'' while dragging the grip. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/d/d3/Button-tracksettings.png
Next appears the '''track tools menu''' icon. This displays a drop-down menu with two options: '''clone track''' and '''remove track'''. <br> 
Cloning a track makes an exact copy of the track and its contents and pastes them at the bottom of the track list. <br> 
Hopefully it won't be necessary to explain what removing a track does. :-)

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/8/89/Button-solomute.png
After this is the '''mute control'''.  This allows you to turn off the sound of this track temporarily. <br> 
This is useful, for example, when you want to hear the sound of an accompanying instrument without the lead instrument. <br> 
Right clicking on the track gives you the option to [[0.4:Working with Automation|automate]] the muting process on the track, although this is strongly discouraged in preference to automating the volume control. <br> 

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/53/Trackbar-name.png

The rest of the track settings displays the '''sound source''' information. <br> 
This varies between instrument tracks, sample tracks and beat/bassline tracks.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/71/Trackbar1-instrument.png <br> 
For '''instrument tracks''' you get a volume and a pan control (also automatable). <br>
A drop-down menu to select the track's midi inputs and outputs (in track tools menu). <br>
and the button that displays the instrument's plugin and preset name. <br> 
Clicking on it opens the actual instrument editor. <br> 
Right-clicking opens a dialog to rename that track. <br> 
At the far right of the sound source there is an "activity bar" which lights up when the instrument is actually playing.
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-settings-activity-off.png <br> 
You can also click on it to preview the sound.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b5/Trackbar2-sample.png <br> 
For '''sample tracks''' you get also a volume control (likewise also automatable). <br> 
Clicking on the track name button allows you to set up [[LADSPA|effects]] on the sample track. <br> 
Right-clicking opens a dialog to rename that track.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/64/Trackbar3-beatbassline.png <br> 
For '''beat/bassline tracks''', you get a graphic displaying the content of the pattern. <br> 
Clicking on it opens the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]], if it's not already open. <br> 
Right-clicking opens a dialog to rename that track.

= Track Context Menu =

The track context menu appears when you right-click on an element of a track's activity.  The options presented depend on which type of track it is.

== Instrument Tracks ==

The instrument track context menu looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/b3/Contextmenu-pianoroll.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

This gives you the most options of all the song editor context menus.

'''Open in piano-roll''' opens the clicked-on segment in the [[Piano Roll Editor]] (strangely enough).

'''Delete''' deletes the clicked-on segment.

'''Cut''' removes the clicked-on segment and puts it in the clipboard.

'''Copy''' takes a copy of the clicked-on segment and puts it in the clipboard.

'''Paste''' pastes the contents of the clipboard into this segment, overwriting its previous contents.

'''Mute/Unmute''' allows you to turn sound off or on for this track while editing it. 
This does not affect the set volume of the track, but acts like the 'mute' button on a mixing desk.

'''Clear all notes''' allows you to erase the contents of the clicked-on segment without deleting the segment itself. <br> 
Normally the name of the instrument is given to the segment. <br> 
This is copied and pasted with the contents of the segment, so you can see the original source of this segment. <br> 

'''Reset name''' allows you to reset that name to the name of the instrument plugin of the track, and '''Change name''' allows you to edit it manually.

'''Freeze''' allows you to [[Glossary#F|freeze]] the sound of this track by creating a pre-rendered sample of the track alone. <br> 
This cuts down on the workload of rendering this track, which may be useful on low-powered systems or tracks with complex effects and melodies. <br> 
You can edit the track's contents while the track is frozen, but the edits do not take effect until it is thawed or refrozen. <br> 

'''Add steps''' and '''Remove Steps''' allow you to add or remove a number steps (equal to a 16th note) selected from a submenu to the end of a pattern. <br> 
This is similar to the same option in the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] but seems to have little purpose here.

== Sample Tracks ==

The sample track context menu looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/71/Contextmenu-sampletrack.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The actions of each option are essentially the same as those for the instrument track above.

== Beat/Bassline Tracks ==

The beat/bassline track context menu looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/66/Contextmenu-bb-editor.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

The actions of each option are essentially the same as those for the instrument track above.  The only addition is:

'''Change color''' allows you to change the colour of the bassline track. <br> 
This allows you to coordinate the function or content of the tracks by their colour, <br>
allowing you to quickly work out which bassline in a complex rhythm section you are dealing with.
