Automation is a powerful tool for customising the sound of your project. You can use it to do tasks as simple as automating a mixing desk (moving the volume levels up and down as the song progresses), or as complex as varying the sound of an instrument, its effects settings, and even the tempo of the entire song.  Almost any GUI control can be automated allowing for very powerful control of your song.

'''Controls''' are the knobs, sliders, LED toggle switches, and digital readouts that can be found on the GUIs within LMMS (see image at left). All controls on default LMMS GUIs can be automated, even option selector buttons and drop-down menus!

= What can be Automated? =

The list of controls that can be automated is vast, as can be seen from the list in the [[Automation Editor#What_can_be_automated.3F|Automation Editor]] manual page. If you're unsure if a control can be automated, right-click on its icon and look for a context menu item called '''Edit song-global automation'''. If it's there, the item probably can be automated; however, in the case of instruments, only controls on the '''built-in LMMS instruments''' can be automated. You '''cannot''' automate any controls on third-party VST instruments, including '''zynAddSubFX''', even though it is included with LMMS.

= Song-global vs Automation Tracks =

There are 2 ways to automate a control: Song-global automation and Automation tracks.

== Song-global automation ==
'''Song-global automation''' is a way to automate a control directly without using an automation track. You right-click a control and select '''Edit song-global automation'''. The Automation Editor will open and allow you to automate the control. For Song-global automation, the bar numbers shown in the Automation Editor window are the same as the bar numbers of the song starting at bar #1. If you want to automate a change for this control at bar #7 in the song, you do that at bar #7 in the Automation Editor. When you close the Automation Editor window, you have '''no''' indicators that this control has any automated actions attached. This is '''not''' the recommended way to automate a control.

== Automation Tracks ==
'''Automation Tracks''' are specialized tracks you can add to the Song-Editor. You can create blocks in the automation tracks, the same as you would in an instrument track. Then, you can '''connect''' (bind) controls to blocks within the automation track (explained below). You double-click a block that has a connected control, and it will open in the Automation Editor. Unlike Song-global automation, the bar numbers shown in the Automation Editor do '''not''' correspond to the bar numbers in the song. Instead, they are relative to the automation block's start position in the track. For example, if an automation block begins at bar #4 in the song, then bar #1 in the Automation Editor corresponds to bar #4 in the song. Furthermore, when you close the Automation Editor window, you have indicators in the automation track block that this control has automated actions attached. This is the '''recommended''' way to automate a control. It's good practice to keep the Automation Tracks adjacent (in the stacking order) to the Song-Editor tracks where the automated control is located--this helps to keep you organised.

The '''Beat+Bassline Editor''' supports Automation Tracks independently of the Song-Editor. However, it is very difficult to find any predictable correlation between the beat step timeline and the bar timeline in the Automation Track Editor when editing automation tracks located in the Beat+Bassline Editor. In simple terms, this means you'll find it very difficult to coordinate the automation graph with the beats. The recommended way to automate Beat/Bassline tracks is to use Song-Editor automation tracks.

= Song-Editor Automation Tracks =

It's best to manage automations using Automation Tracks in the [[Song Editor|Song-Editor]]. You can add an Automation Track in the Song-Editor by clicking the "Add automation-track" button. Then, just like an instrument track, you can add an empty block to a bar by clicking in an empty bar in the track. [[File:LMMS-auto-editor.png|frame|right|alt=Instrument automation tracks & editor.|Instrument automation tracks & editor.]] Then, to automate a control using your new automation track, '''Ctrl+drag''' the icon of an automatable control into a bar or block in the new automation track. If you have an automation block that already contains 1 or more controls, when you Ctrl+drag another control into the block, the second control becomes controlled by that automation block, too. You can also Ctrl+drag a different control into a different bar or block of the same automation track. This means that you can:
* automate multiple controls simultaneously in the same block of a track, and 
* automate multiple controls sequentially in different blocks of the same track.
For a specific block in an automation track, you can list the controls it automates by right-clicking the block in the Song-Editor; the '''Connections''' (connected controls) will be listed at the bottom. The "Connections" context menu item gives you the option to release (disconnect) a connected control from that automation block.

To edit the automation within a block, double-click on the automation track block to open it in the [[Automation Editor]]. Just like other blocks in the Song-Editor, the right-click context menu offers delete, cut, copy, paste, mute/unmute, clear, and rename. Using the mouse, you can move (drag) and lengthen/shorten the duration (drag 2-headed arrow) of an Automation block. The image to the right is an example of 2 automation tracks below an instrument track. The 1st automation track fades-in the volume from zero, holds it steady a while, then fades back down to zero. The 2nd automation track is opened in the Automation Editor, and shows an automation of stereo panning from full right (up), to full left (down), to full right (up), then back to equal (center).

The image below is an example of automating a Beat+Bassline instrument using a Song-Editor automation track. The Automation track is connected to the '''base note''' control (see yellow arrow pointing at green square) in the Audiofile Processor plugin for "kick_distorted01.ogg". The automation track moves the base note control up and down the plugin's keyboard thereby varying the key of the kick drum 4 times in a span of 12 bars.[[File:LMMS-auto-BB-track.png|frame|center|alt=Beat/Bassline automation track & editor.|Beat/Bassline automation track & editor.]]

= Automation Examples =

== Fading in ==

The simplest use for Automation is to fade-in an instrument at the start of its performance, so it doesn't join the song abruptly. This is accomplished by automating the volume control of the instrument using an Automation Track in the Song-Editor. Because the fade-in will usually last for several bars, it's easier to draw a diagonal line of the desired length after you adjust the horizontal magnification to show the number of bars you need and adjust the vertical magnification to show the range of values you need (see magenta arrow pointing to magenta box in the image). Having many control points on your automation graph is unnecessary because human hearing is not very sensitive to small changes in volume. Also, more control points means more editing later if you change your mind. For example, in the image, the '''Q''' (quantisation) is set to 1/8 (i.e. 8 control points per bar) which gives a relatively straight line without having many unnecessary control points (see magenta arrow pointing to magenta box in the image). 

The example in the image automates the increase in volume of the instrument track above it from zero volume to 93 in the span of 4 bars and leaves the volume at 93. Notice that the start of the automation track block is exactly aligned to the start of the instrument track block it controls; therefore, they are exactly in sync (i.e. their bar numbers correspond exactly). Also notice that the automation track block ends before the instrument block ends, so what happens? '''''Answer''''': when the automation track block ends, it leaves the instrument volume at whatever level it was at the instant the automation block ended. The instrument volume will stay at that volume unless it is changed by some other automation downstream in the timeline.

== Adding expression ==

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| valign="top"|
You can automate the '''Master Tempo''' control to slow down as the performance approaches the end of a phrase (a '''Rallentando''') and have it resume its pace immediately afterward. This gives your song '''expression''', as if a live piano player were emphasising that section. The tempo automation graph looks like a single "negative" sawtooth pattern.

== Eighties acid effects ==

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house Acid House] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_trance Acid Trance] movements were famous for using the Roland TB303 to play a repetitive melody and and then varying the filter cutoff frequency (and other envelope parameters) to change the sound over the length of the song.  Because of the repetitive nature of the melody you might be tempted to use a Beat/Bassline track to store the melody, but any automation in the Beat+Bassline Editor repeats as the beat pattern repeats instead of changing continuously throughout the song.

First, create a new track in the Song-Editor using any instrument, put a bar of notes in it, and then make that bar repetitive by copying it to create 24 total bars. In the example project file, I opened the bar in the Piano Roll, copied bar #1, and pasted it 3 times to create a 4-bar phrase. Back in the Song-Editor, I copied that 4-bar block, and pasted it 5 times to get six 4-bar blocks (= 24 total bars). 

Next, add an '''Automation Track''' to the Song-Editor.

[[File:LMMS-auto-acid-filter.png|frame|left|alt=Acid filter setup.|Acid filter setup.]]
| valign="top"|
Next, open the instrument's plugin settings window and select the Env/LFO tab:
# Turn on the '''Filter''' section,
# Set the filter type to '''Moog''',
# Make sure that the LFO's '''AMT''' (amount) is set to zero,
# Ctrl+drag the filter's '''Cutoff''' control to the automation track in the Song-Editor.
|}

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| valign="top"|
Align the start of the Automation block with the start of the Instrument block (bar #3 in the example project file). By aligning them, the bar numbers in the instrument and automation blocks will correspond.

Double-click the automation track block to open it in the Automation Editor. Using the mouse, draw various shapes: blocks, rising/falling curves, sawteeth, and jumps. Drawing with the mouse can be difficult. Use Shift+click to draw a straight line--this gives you a bit more control to draw fine, gradual changes.

[[File:LMMS-auto-acid-graph.png|thumb|center|800px|alt=Acid filter cutoff automation graph.|Acid filter cutoff automation graph.]]

Remember that '''Q''' (quantisation) sets the resolution of control points (number of control points per bar), and it may affect the sound. Starting at bar #9 there are 4 upward sweeps with the Q set to 1/16, and then starting from bar #13 there are 4 downward sweeps with the Q set to 1/32 (i.e. twice as many control points). As LMMS follows the automation curve during rendering, it doesn't change the filter cutoff frequency in an analog fashion, like someone turning a knob. The cutoff frequency is changed digitally (in steps), so it actually jumps instantly from one setting to the next. The Q value sets the time duration between these steps. This means that coarse Q values may allow you to hear the changes in cutoff frequency as distinct steps--the 4 upward sweeps (coarser Q) may sound a little stuttery or jerky, and the downward sweeps (finer Q) may sound smoother. For even finer control, you may want to use a Q of 1/64.  But, because it is more difficult to draw a truly smooth curve when drawing with a mouse, the downside of finer Q values is that your own inaccuracies in drawing the control points become audible and are harder to edit out.

== Sounds flying past ==

This example is a series of stacatto claps in a Beat/Bassline track that "fly" from right-to-left then back left-to-right, like a drive-by shooting.

<br>

[[File:LMMS-auto-fly-by.png|frame|center|alt=Automate stereo panning for fly-by.|Automate stereo panning for fly-by.]]

Make a staccato beat with "clap01.ogg", and repeat it for 4 bars in the Song-Editor. To automate the fly-by, '''Ctrl+drag''' the "clap01.ogg" Pan control to an Automation track in the Song-Editor, then double-click the Automation track block to open it in the Automation Editor. In the Automation Editor use the Draw mode tool to:
# click at 100 (full right) at the beginning of bar #1
# Shift+click at -100 (full left) at the end of bar #2
# Shift+click at 100 (full right) at the end of bar #4
# Shift+click at 0 (center) at the end of bar #4

And now the clap sounds "fly" from right-to-left and back again!

= When not to use Automation =

Alhough Automation gives you great power and flexibility, there are times when it is overkill and times when there are easier ways to achieve your goal.
* Automation currently lacks any tools to make regular shapes such as sine waves. Drawing sine waves by dragging your mouse can be quite difficult, especially over a long period of bars. Instead, you can use an LFO, either in the instrument plugin or as an effect.
* Automation can be applied to change the characteristics of each note individually. For example, to have a note gradually fade away or gradually introduce vibrato, but it is tedious to do this to every note.  The LFO settings in the instrument plugin's Env/LFO section allow you to set the attack rate of the LFO to gradually fade-in vibrato, and the envelope can be set to give a long decay time.
