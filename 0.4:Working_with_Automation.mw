Automation is a powerful tool for customising the sound of your project. You can use it to do tasks as simple as automating a mixing desk (moving the volume levels up and down as the song progresses), or as complex as varying the sound of an instrument, its effects settings, and even the tempo of the entire song.  Almost any GUI control can be automated allowing for very powerful control of your song.

'''Controls''' are the knobs, sliders, LED toggle switches, and digital readouts that can be found on the GUIs within LMMS (see image at left). All controls on default LMMS GUIs can be automated, even option selector buttons and drop-down menus!

= What can be Automated? =

The list of controls that can be automated is vast, as can be seen from the list in the [[Automation Editor#What_can_be_automated.3F|Automation Editor]] manual page. If you're unsure if a control can be automated, right-click on its icon and look for a context menu item called '''Edit song-global automation'''. If it's there, the item probably can be automated; however, in the case of instruments, only controls on the '''built-in LMMS instruments''' can be automated. You '''cannot''' automate any controls on third-party VST instruments, including '''zynAddSubFX''', even though it is included with LMMS.
<br>

= Song-global vs Automation Tracks =

There are 2 ways to automate a control: Song-global automation and Automation tracks.

== Song-global automation ==
'''Song-global automation''' is a way to automate a control directly without using an automation track. You right-click a control and select '''Edit song-global automation'''. The Automation Editor will open and allow you to automate the control. For Song-global automation, the bar numbers shown in the Automation Editor window are the same as the bar numbers of the song starting at bar #1. If you want to automate a change for this control at bar #7 in the song, you do that at bar #7 in the Automation Editor. When you close the Automation Editor window, you have '''no''' indicators that this control has any automated actions attached. This is '''not''' the recommended way to automate a control.

== Automation Tracks ==
'''Automation Tracks''' are specialized tracks you can add to the Song-Editor. You can create blocks in the automation tracks, the same as you would in an instrument track. Then, you can '''connect''' (bind) controls to blocks within the automation track (explained below). You double-click a block that has a connected control, and it will open in the Automation Editor. Unlike Song-global automation, the bar numbers shown in the Automation Editor do '''not''' correspond to the bar numbers in the song. Instead, they are relative to the automation block's start position in the track. For example, if an automation block begins at bar #4 in the song, then bar #1 in the Automation Editor corresponds to bar #4 in the song. Furthermore, when you close the Automation Editor window, you have indicators in the automation track block that this control has automated actions attached. This is the '''recommended''' way to automate a control. It's good practice to keep the Automation Tracks adjacent (in the stacking order) to the Song-Editor tracks where the automated control is located--this helps to keep you organised.

The '''Beat+Bassline Editor''' supports Automation Tracks independently of the Song-Editor. However, it is very difficult to find any predictable correlation between the beat step timeline and the bar timeline in the Automation Track Editor when editing automation tracks located in the Beat+Bassline Editor. In simple terms, this means you'll find it very difficult to coordinate the automation graph with the beats. The recommended way to automate Beat/Bassline tracks is to use Song-Editor automation tracks.

= Song-Editor Automation Tracks =

It's best to manage automations using Automation Tracks in the [[Song Editor|Song-Editor]]. You can add an Automation Track in the Song-Editor by clicking the "Add automation-track" button. Then, just like an instrument track, you can add an empty block to a bar by clicking in an empty bar in the track. [[File:LMMS-auto-editor.png|frame|right|alt=Instrument automation tracks & editor.|Instrument automation tracks & editor.]] Then, to automate a control using your new automation track, '''Ctrl+drag''' the icon of an automatable control into a bar or block in the new automation track. If you have an automation block that already contains 1 or more controls, when you Ctrl+drag another control into the block, the second control becomes controlled by that automation block, too. You can also Ctrl+drag a different control into a different bar or block of the same automation track. This means that you can:
* automate multiple controls simultaneously in the same block of a track, and 
* automate multiple controls sequentially in different blocks of the same track.
For a specific block in an automation track, you can list the controls it automates by right-clicking the block in the Song-Editor; the '''Connections''' (connected controls) will be listed at the bottom. The "Connections" context menu item gives you the option to release (disconnect) a connected control from that automation block.

To edit the automation within a block, double-click on the automation track block to open it in the [[Automation Editor]]. Just like other blocks in the Song-Editor, the right-click context menu offers delete, cut, copy, paste, mute/unmute, clear, and rename. Using the mouse, you can move (drag) and lengthen/shorten the duration (drag 2-headed arrow) of an Automation block. The image to the right is an example of 2 automation tracks below an instrument track. The 1st automation track fades-in the volume from zero, holds it steady a while, then fades back down to zero. The 2nd automation track is opened in the Automation Editor, and shows an automation of stereo panning from full left, to full right, to full left, then back to center.

The image below is an example of automating a Beat+Bassline instrument using a Song-Editor automation track. The Automation track is connected to the '''base note''' control (see yellow arrow pointing at green square) in the Audiofile Processor plugin for "kick_distorted01.ogg". The automation track moves the base note control up and down the plugin's keyboard thereby varying the key of the kick drum 4 times in a span of 12 bars.[[File:LMMS-auto-BB-track.png|frame|center|alt=Beat/Bassline automation track & editor.|Beat/Bassline automation track & editor.]]

= Automation Examples =

== Fading in ==

The simplest use for Automation is to fade-in an instrument at the start of its performance, so it doesn't join the song abruptly. This is accomplished by automating the volume control of the instrument using an Automation Track in the Song-Editor. Because the fade-in will usually last for several bars, it's easier to draw a diagonal line of the desired length after you adjust the horizontal magnification to show the number of bars you need and adjust the vertical magnification to show the range of values you need (see magenta arrow pointing to magenta box in the image). Having many control points on your automation graph is unnecessary because human hearing is not very sensitive to small changes in volume. Also, more control points means more editing later if you change your mind. For example, in the image, the '''Q''' (quantisation) is set to 1/8 (i.e. 8 control points per bar) which gives a relatively straight line without having many unnecessary control points (see magenta arrow pointing to magenta box in the image). 

The example in the image automates the increase in volume of the instrument track above it from zero volume to 93 in the span of 4 bars and leaves the volume at 93. Notice that the start of the automation track block is exactly aligned to the start of the instrument track block it controls; therefore, they are exactly in sync (i.e. their bar numbers correspond exactly). Also notice that the automation track block ends before the instrument block ends, so what happens? '''''Answer''''': when the automation track block ends, it leaves the instrument volume at whatever level it was at the instant the automation block ended. The instrument volume will stay at that volume unless it is changed by some other automation downstream in the timeline.

== Adding expression ==

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| valign="top"|
You can automate the '''Master Tempo''' control to slow down as the performance approaches the end of a phrase (a '''Rallentando''') and have it resume its pace immediately afterward. This gives your song '''expression''', as if a live piano player were emphasising that section. The tempo automation graph looks like a single "negative" sawtooth pattern.

== Eighties acid effects ==

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house Acid House] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_trance Acid Trance] movements were famous for using the Roland TB303 to play a repetitive melody and varying the filter cutoff frequency and other envelope parameters to change the sound through the entire piece.  Because of the repetitive nature of the melody it is tempting to use a bassline to store the melody, but the automation in the Beat / Bassline Editor only goes for as long as the pattern - therefore, the automation you put in will repeat itself every time the pattern repeats, rather than continuously changing.

First, create a new track with any instrument, put a bar of repetitive notes in it, and then copy that to create sixteen bars (I copy that bar in the piano roll and paste it three times to create a four-bar phrase, and then copy that segment in the song editor to get four four-bar segments).  Then open the instrument's plugin and select the Envelope/LFO/Filter tab:

</center>

Turn on the Filter section, set the filter type to Moog, and make sure that the LFO amount is set to zero.  

<center>

</center>

Then right-click on the filter's '''Cutoff''' control and automate it:

</center>

You can draw various shapes - blocks, rising and falling curves, sawteeth and jumps.
It can be difficult to draw with the mouse. Since .4.4 sh+leftMouse Clicking will create strait connected lines. Use this to make slow fine linear gradual changes.

It is worth noting here that the frequency of control points changes the sound.  At bar 17 there are four upward sweeps with the quantisation set to 1/16, and then from bar 21 there are four downward sweeps with the quantisation set to 1/32 (i.e. twice as many control points).  The changes to the filter cutoff do not happen in an analog fashion, like someone turning a knob - they happen digitally and jump instantly between settings.  This means that you can hear the changes in frequency as distinct steps - the four upward sweeps may sound a little stuttery or jerky and the downward sweeps may sound smoother.  For fine control you may even want to use 1/64th quantisation.  However, since it is more difficult to get a truly even curve or line by drawing, the downside to this approach may be that your own inaccuracies in drawing the control points become audible and are harder to edit out.

== Sounds flying past ==

In one song I wrote I had a series of stacatto claps in a pattern and I want them to fly from right to left, like a drive-by shooting.  I automated the pan control (i.e. the X direction) of the instrument in the beat-bassline editor:

<center>
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/automation-howto-flyby-1.png
</center>

I then created a diagonal line from pan-right (+1024 at top) to pan-left (-1024 at bottom):

<center>
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/automation-howto-flyby-2.png
</center>

And now the sound 'flies' past from right to left!

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/sounds/automation-howto-flyby.ogg

Notice that the sound 'resets' to the right after each bar, because the pattern is only one bar long.  If I wanted another set of claps that flew in the other direction, I have a couple of options:

* I can create a second pattern that has automation taking it from left to right and alternate the patterns in the song.  This means that you have a second track, which may be inconvenient.
* I can add a second bar of notes (via the pattern's context menu '''Add Steps''' option) and then have the automation return to the right.  This would limit me to having the claps return immediately after they left, which may not work in the piece.

= When not to use Automation =

Alhough Automation gives you great power and flexibility, there are times when it is overkill and times when there are easier ways to achieve your goal.
* Automation currently lacks any tools to make regular shapes such as sine waves. Drawing sine waves by dragging your mouse can be quite difficult, especially over a long period of bars. Instead, you can use an LFO, either in the instrument plugin or as an effect.
* Automation can be applied to change the characteristics of each note individually. For example, to have a note gradually fade away or gradually introduce vibrato, but it is tedious to do this to every note.  The LFO settings in the instrument plugin's Env/LFO section allow you to set the attack rate of the LFO to gradually fade-in vibrato, and the envelope can be set to give a long decay time.
