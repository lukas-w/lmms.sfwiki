The Beat + Bassline Editor is the main mechanism for sequencing rhythms and repetitive musical lines in LMMS.  It looks like this:

= Tool Bar =

The tool bar of the Beat + Bassline Editor looks like this:

The '''play''' and '''stop''' buttons (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/bbeditor-toolbar-playback.png) allow you to play the currently selected pattern.  When '''play''' is pressed, it will be replaced with a '''pause''' symbol (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/icons-pause.png) allowing you to pause the playback rather than stop it entirely.  Stopping the playback returns you to the first step in the pattern, pause will allow you to continue from the step last played.

The next drop-down menu (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/bbeditor-toolbar-bassline.png) allows you to select the '''bassline''' to edit.  It displays the current bassline being edited.

The '''new bassline''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/bbeditor-toolbar-new-bassline.png) creates a new bassline, incrementally numbered from "Beat/Bassline 0" up.  This can (and should) be renamed in the [[Song Editor]] to make it easier to identify which pattern you are editing.

= Instrument Track =

Each instrument added to the Beat + Bassline Editor is listed in a bar looking like this:

== Instrument Settings ==

The instrument settings are very similar to the [[Song Editor]]'s [[Song Editor#The Track Settings bar|track settings]] bar.  This gives you a way to move the instrument up and down in the order, clone or remove the instrument, change or automate the volume, and set the instrument's [[Plugins|plugin]] settings.

== Steps ==

To the right are shown sixteen steps, four to each beat in a four-beat bar.  Each step is a button that can be turned on and off.  When a step is turned on, the sound from the instrument will play at that step in the bar.  The four steps in each beats are shaded alternately light and dark to make them easier to pick quickly.

== Adding and removing steps ==

It is possible to add steps to and remove steps from the step display.  This simply adds an extra bar (or more) and puts steps in that, so it does not change the tempo of the beats currently in the track or the duration of each step.  You cannot remove steps so that there would be less than sixteen steps.  Though it is possible to add or remove steps in increments of one, two, four, eight or sixteen, it makes little sense to add less than sixteen at a time.
