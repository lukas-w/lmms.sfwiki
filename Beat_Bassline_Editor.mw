The Beat + Bassline Editor is the main mechanism for sequencing rhythms and repetitive musical lines in LMMS.  It looks like this:

= Tool Bar =

The tool bar of the Beat + Bassline Editor looks like this:

The '''play''' and '''stop''' buttons (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-bbeditor-toolbar-playback.png) allow you to play the currently selected pattern.  When '''play''' is pressed, it will be replaced with a '''pause''' symbol (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmss-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-icons-pause.png) allowing you to pause the playback rather than stop it entirely.  Stopping the playback returns you to the first step in the pattern, pause will allow you to continue from the step last played.

The next drop-down menu (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-bbeditor-toolbar-bassline.png) allows you to select the '''bassline''' to edit.  It displays the current bassline being edited.

The '''new bassline''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-bbeditor-toolbar-new-bassline.png) creates a new bassline, incrementally numbered from "Beat/Bassline 0" up.  This can (and should) be renamed in the [[Song Editor]] to make it easier to identify which pattern you are editing.

= Instrument Track =

Each instrument added to the Beat + Bassline Editor is listed in a bar looking like this:

== Instrument Settings ==

The instrument settings are very similar to the [[Song Editor]]'s [[Song Editor#The Track Settings bar|track settings]] bar.  This gives you a way to move the instrument up and down in the order, clone or remove the instrument, change or automate the volume, and set the instrument's [[Plugins|plugin]] settings.
