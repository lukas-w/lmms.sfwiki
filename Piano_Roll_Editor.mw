The Piano Roll Editor is the main method of working with melodies and harmonies.

It can be accessed by double-clicking a track segment created in an instrument track (e.g. http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-segment-piano-empty.png).  It can also be accessed using the 'show piano roll' button in the main tool bar (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-pianoroll.png), but this does not open any piano roll in particular and you will not be able to add notes.  A message will be displayed in the window telling you to double-click in a track segment first.

The piano roll editor looks like this:

The Piano Roll toolbar looks like this:

<!--{\end{center}}-->

Many of the tools are similar to those found in the [[Song Editor]] but there are several important additions.  In addition, there are slight but key changes in the way editing is done in the Piano Roll Editor.  At this stage it means learning two slightly incompatible editing styles.

== Playback ==

The playback controls look like http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-playback.png

This gives you the standard play and stop controls, with the addition of a '''record''' button.  Pressing this will start recording the notes you play on a MIDI keyboard or your computer's keyboard (see [[Working with Instruments#Piano Keys|the Piano Keys section]] for more details).  Press '''stop''' to stop recording.  You can also press the space bar to toggle between play and stop (which also works when recording).

== Editing ==

The editing tools look like http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-editing.png

This is where the key difference between editing in the Piano Roll and in the Song Editor comes in.  The four tools you have '''create''' notes, '''erase''' notes, draw '''selections''' and '''move''' selections.  The behaviour of the create and erase tools will be detailed in the [[#Notes|notes]] section below.

The selection tools allow you to move areas of notes around, as well as cutting and copying areas of notes using the clipboard (see below).  Use the selection tool to draw rectangular areas on the piano roll, and notes whose start falls within that area will be selected.  You can then move these notes by selecting the move tool and dragging any selected note.  You can move notes both earlier (left) or later (right) in time, but up and down in pitch as well.  The selection cannot go past the front of the rectangle selected, however, so it often help to leave little extra space on the left side of the drawn area.  It may also help that when the move tool is selected, you can drag on any part of the piano roll to move the notes, not just inside the selection.

== Clipboard ==

The clipboard tools look like http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-clipboard.png

The selection tools above also allow you to cut, copy and paste areas of notes.  There are two things to note when pasting notes, however:

* Notes are pasted into the start of the bar that is shown in the piano roll editor when the notes are pasted.  Therefore you must position the window to start at the bar you want the notes to be placed into before pasting.
* The notes you've just pasted are not selected.

A further gotcha is:

* While you have the note movement tool active and notes are selected, any drag operation on the piano roll will move those notes, whether or not you start the drag inside the selection area or not.

This interface is planned to be improved and simplified in future versions of LMMS.

== Playback Control ==

The playback control tools look like http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-playcontrol.png These have essentially the same function as the same tools in the Song Editor.

== Zoom ==

You can alter the size of a bar as displayed on screen by choosing a magnification from the zoom control (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-zoom-100.png).  You can also control the zoom level by holding down the ''Ctrl'' key and rolling the mouse wheel up or down.

== Quantisation ==

The current [[Glossary#quantisation|quantisation]] setting is displayed in a drop-down menu: http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-quantise-16.png This allows you to set the minimum 'step' of the start or length of each note when recording, or when using the pencil tool.

== Note Length ==

The current note length setting is displayed in a drop-down menu http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/pianoroll-toolbar-notelen-last.png This controls the length of notes made with the creation tool. You can either specify a given note length, or specify that the next note will be the same length as the last note.

= Keyboard =

Below the tool bar on the left-hand side of the window is the keyboard. This shows a segment of a keyboard, seen side-on, that relates to the notes displayed in the piano roll.

This can be scrolled up and down using the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the piano roll, or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse.  You can also click on this to play the corresponding note.

The main area of the Piano Roll Editor is the note area:
