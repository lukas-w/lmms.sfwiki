The Piano Roll Editor is the main method of working with melodies and harmonies.  It looks like this:

The Piano Roll toolbar looks like this:

Many of the tools are similar to those found in the [[Song Editor]] but there are several important additions.  In addition, there are slight but key changes in the way editing is done in the Piano Roll Editor.  At this stage it means learning two slightly incompatible editing styles.

== Playback ==

The playback controls look like:

This gives you the standard play and stop controls, with the addition of a '''record''' button.  Pressing this will start recording the notes you play on a MIDI keyboard or your computer's keyboard (see [[Working with Instruments#Piano Keys|the Piano Keys section]] for more details).  Press '''stop''' to stop recording.  You can also press the space bar to toggle between play and stop (which also works when recording).

== Editing ==

The editing tools look like:

This is where the key difference between editing in the Piano Roll and in the Song Editor comes in.  The four tools you have '''create''' notes, '''erase''' notes, draw '''selections''' and '''move''' selections.  The behaviour of the create and erase tools will be detailed in the [[#Notes|notes]] section below.

The selection tools allow you to move areas of notes around, as well as cutting and copying areas of notes using the clipboard (see below).  Use the selection tool to draw rectangular areas on the piano roll, and notes whose start falls within that area will be selected.  You can then move these notes by selecting the move tool and dragging any selected note.  You can move notes both earlier (left) or later (right) in time, but up and down in pitch as well.  The selection cannot go past the front of the rectangle selected, however, so it often help to leave little extra space on the left side of the drawn area.  It may also help that when the move tool is selected, you can drag on any part of the piano roll to move the notes, not just inside the selection.

== Clipboard ==

The clipboard tools look like:

The selection tools above also allow you to cut, copy and paste areas of notes.  There are several minor 'gotchas' at of revision 0.3.1, however:

* The place notes are pasted is often not the same as the place notes are copied or cut from.  It seems reliable when the start of the region is within the first bar, but from there it's a bit random.
* The notes you've just pasted are not selected.

== Playback Control ==

The playback control tools look like:

These have essentially the same function as the same tools in the Song Editor.

== Zoom ==

You can alter the size of a bar as displayed on screen by choosing a magnification from the zoom control:

== Quantisation ==

The current [[Glossary#quantisation|quantisation]] setting is displayed in a drop-down menu:

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-pianoroll-toolbar-quantise-16.png

This allows you to set the minimum 'step' of the start or length of each note when recording.  It has no effect on notes made with the creation tool.

== Note Length ==

The current note length setting is displayed in a drop-down menu:

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-pianoroll-toolbar-notelen-last.png

This controls the length of notes made with the creation tool.  You can either specify a given note length, or specify that the next note will be the same length as the last note.

= Keyboard =

Below the tool bar on the left-hand side of the window is the keyboard.  This shows a segment of a keyboard, seen side-on, that relates to the notes displayed in the piano roll.

This can be scrolled up and down using the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the piano roll, or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse.  You can also click on this to play the corresponding note.
