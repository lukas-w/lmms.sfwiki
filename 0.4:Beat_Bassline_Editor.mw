{{0.4:Beat Bassline EditorTrans}}

The Beat + Bassline Editor is the main window for sequencing rhythms and repetitive musical lines in LMMS.  It looks like this:

= Tool Bar =

The tool bar of the Beat + Bassline Editor looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/8/8a/Bb-editor-toolbar.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

'''Play''' & '''Stop''' buttons allow you to play and stop the currently selected Beat/Bassline (BB) track. <br> 
When '''Play''' is pressed, it will be replaced with a '''Pause''' symbol allowing you to pause the playback rather than stop it entirely. <br> 
'''Stop''' returns the playhead to the first step in the BB track; '''Pause''' allows you to continue from the last played step.

<!--{\end{center}}-->

The drop-down menu allows you to select the '''Beat/Bassline (BB) track''' to edit. It displays the current BB track being edited.

The '''Add Beat/Bassline''' button creates a new Beat/Bassline (BB) track to the Song-Editor, numbered sequentially from "Beat/Bassline 0". Right-click on the new BB track's name in the [[0.4:Song Editor|Song Editor]] and rename it to something useful--this makes it easier to identify which pattern you are editing. '''''Warning: all the BB tracks you create are linked in such a way that they share the same instruments.''''' If you delete or mute an instrument in one BB track, it's deleted from or muted in all the BB tracks in this project. So, if you want multiple BB tracks in you song, all the BB tracks will contain the same instruments. This means that you'll have to remove the notes (beats) on those instruments that you want silenced in a particular BB track. For example, say you have a first BB track with a kick drum, snare, and hihat, and a second BB track with just a clap and a shaker. All 5 instruments will be in both BB tracks. You'll have to remove any notes (beats) in the clap and shaker instruments in the first track which will make them silent--if you try to mute the clap or shaker instrument tracks, it won't work because the clap and shaker will be muted in all BB tracks. Also, you'll have to remove the notes (beats) from the kick, snare, and hihat in the second BB track to make them silent.

The '''Add Automation track''' button adds a new Automation track to the current BB track.

= Instrument Track =

Each instrument added to the Beat + Bassline Editor is listed in a bar looking like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

The '''Track Settings''' are on the left side and the '''Step Editor''' is on the right (the gray tombstones).

== Track Settings ==

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/71/Trackbar1-instrument.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

* The Track Settings are similar to the [[0.4:Song Editor|Song Editor]]'s [[0.4:Song Editor#The Track Settings bar|track settings]] bar.
* Left-click the instrument's name to open the Instrument Settings window where you can change the instrument's [[Plugins|plugin]] settings.
* Drag the stippled handle on the left end of the instrument track to move the track up or down in the track stacking order.
* Click the '''Actions for this track''' icon to get a menu where you can clone or remove the instrument track.
* Click the toggle switches (LED lights) to mute/unmute or solo/unsolo an instrument.
* Drag up or down on the knobs to change the Volume or Pan.

== Step Editor ==

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/d/df/Bb-editor-stepeditor.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

* By default, an instrument track has 16 steps (16 gray tombstones)--4 steps to each beat in a 4-beat bar.
* Each step is a button that can be turned on and off. You can also hover your mouse over a step and raise or lower its volume by rolling your mouse scroll wheel up or down. The step is bright green at full volume, gray at zero volume, and an intermediate brightness of green at intermediate volumes.
* When a step is turned on, the sound from the instrument will play at that step in the bar.
* The 4 steps in each beat group are shaded alternately light and dark gray to make them easier to pick quickly. 
* Right-clicking on a step for a track gives you the context menu below for that track:

<!--{\end{center}}-->

* '''Open in piano-roll''' allows you to edit the notes of a pattern in the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor|Piano Roll Editor]] rather than just as steps. This allows you to place notes with more than 1/16th precision, and to vary the pitch, length, and volume of the notes (beats).
* '''Copy''' & '''Paste''' allow you to copy a set of steps from one track to another by copying the original track's steps, right-clicking on the new track and choosing Paste.
* '''Mute/Unmute''' allows you to quickly mute or unmute the entire instrument in all patterns.
* '''Clear all notes''' allows you to quickly erase all the steps in this track.
* '''Change Name''' allow you to change the name of this track from the default (i.e. the instrument plugin or sample you loaded). '''Reset Name''' resets it back to this default.
* '''Freeze''' allows you to pre-render the sound of this track. This requires much less CPU time to render the sound of the track compared to playing the same sounds in real time. While the track is frozen, changes to it do not take effect. You can thaw a track while playing, but can only refreeze it when playback is stopped.
* '''Add steps''' & '''Remove steps''' allow you to add steps to or remove steps from the bar. This will add an extra bar (or more) and puts steps in that bar. It does not change the tempo of the beats or the duration of each step. Although it is possible to add or remove steps in increments of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16, it makes little sense to add less than 16 at a time. You cannot decrease the total number of steps to less than 16.
