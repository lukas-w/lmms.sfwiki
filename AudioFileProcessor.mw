The AudioFile Processor plugin is used to play back uncompressed or compressed samples in an instrument.  It looks like this:

The main controls are:

* The '''amplitude''' for playback of the wave file, in percentage of the original. <br> 
You can go above 100% if your wave file is quiet and you want to make it louder. <br> 
If the master volume or the volume of the instrument or track is low enough you won't cause any clipping, <br> 
because of the way the audio signal is processed in LMMS, <br>
Naturally, you can also quiet a sound down by using percentages less than 100%. <br> 
However, this won't correct clipping that was present in the original file. <br> 
* The '''start''' and '''end''' of playback of the sample. <br> 
This can be used if you only want to play back a specific part of a sample. <br> 
<br>
The symbols to the right are also controls:
* The reversed R controls the '''direction''' of playback. <br> 
When inactive, the sample is played forward; when active, the sample is played in reverse.
* The cyclic arrows control whether the sample is '''repeated''' from the beginning. <br> 
Once it reaches the end (or vice versa for reversed playback) if the note is still held down and playback has progressed all the way through the file.
* The icon with two bars and a marker enables stutter-mode. In this mode, sample playback is always started from the point where it last ended. You can
reset the position back to the beginning by playing a very low note, one that is below 20hz in frequency.
* The folder icon allows you to choose a '''new file''' from a file open dialog. <br> 
You can also change the current sample by dragging a sample from the Samples section of the Side Bar.
