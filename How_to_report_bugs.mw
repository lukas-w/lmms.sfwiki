== Online Bug tracker ==
For reporting any kind of bugs, use the [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=105168&atid=640434 bug tracker]. Please take a look at other [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=105168&atid=640434 submitted bugs] before opening a new item as someone else might have reported the same bug.

== How to efficiently report bugs with GDB ==

*If you are using LMMS and encounter a bug, please include a full backtrace:

  $ gdb /usr/bin/lmms
  ...
  (gdb) r <Enter>
  ...
  <do whatever crashes LMMS>
  ...
    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    [Switching to Thread ... (LWP ...)]
  ...
  (gdb) thread apply all backtrace

* The output of this command is interesting for us!  Please either report it to the [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=105168&atid=640434 bug tracker] or email it to the [[mailing lists|mailing list]].

== How to report bugs without GDB ==
* Start a new shell/terminal:
  bash ~ $  ulimit -l unlimited
  bash ~ $  lmms

* Now, when LMMS crashes, there will be a file called "core" in your working directory (~ per the example above).  The file may be large enough to be worth zipping.

* Please send that to "Tobias Doerffel" <tobias.doerffel AT gmail DOT com> so hopefully we can locate the bug.
** If you've been helped on LMMS' mailing-list, please send a mail to the person helping you and put the above address in Cc:

''NOTE: please, do '''not''' send it to the list, it'll be rejected because of its size.''
