Der '''piano roll editor''' ist die Hauptmethode beim Arbeiten mit Melodien und Harmonien und sieht so aus:

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/c/ce/Pianoroll-main.png

<br> 
Der '''piano roll editor''' wird durch ein Doppelklicken auf ein Element in einem Instrument- oder Beat-/Basslinetrack aufgerufen z.B http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/51/Pattern-pianoroll.png. <br> 
Alternativ wird er über den ''show piano roll'' im  Hauptmenü aufgerufen
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/39/Menubar-f7-pianoroll.png '''(F7)''', <br> 
aber dieser Editor bezieht sich auf kein bestimmtes Element und nur duch herziehen eines Elements kann eine Note eingefügt, bearbeitet oder verschoben werden.<br>

Die Piano Roll toolbar sieht so aus:

<!--{\end{center}}-->

Die meisten Tools sind den Tools im [[Song Editor]] ähnlich, aber es gibt ein paar wichtige Ergänzungen. <br> 
Ausserdem gibt es kleine aber feine Unterschiede in der Art der Bearbeitung<br> 
Das bedutet: Man ist gezwungen 2 verschidenen Bearbeitungsstile zu lernen.

== Playback ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/9/9e/Pianoroll-playback.png 

This gives you the standard play and stop controls, with the addition of a '''record''' button.  Pressing this will start recording the notes you play on a MIDI keyboard or your [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor#Keyboard|computer's keyboard]].  Press '''stop''' to stop recording.  You can also press the space bar to toggle between play and stop (which also works when recording).

== Editing ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/f/f2/Pianoroll-editing.png

This is where the key difference between editing in the Piano Roll and in the Song Editor comes in.  The four tools you have '''create''' notes, '''erase''' notes, draw '''selections''' and '''move''' selections.  The behaviour of the create and erase tools will be detailed in the [[#Notes|notes]] section below.

The selection tools allow you to move areas of notes around, as well as cutting and copying areas of notes using the clipboard (see below).  Use the selection tool to draw rectangular areas on the piano roll, and notes whose start falls within that area will be selected.  You can then move these notes by selecting the move tool and dragging any selected note.  You can move notes both earlier (left) or later (right) in time, but up and down in pitch as well.  The selection cannot go past the front of the rectangle selected, however, so it often help to leave little extra space on the left side of the drawn area.  It may also help that when the move tool is selected, you can drag on any part of the piano roll to move the notes, not just inside the selection.

== Clipboard ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/3f/Pianoroll-clipboard.png

The selection tools above also allow you to cut, copy and paste areas of notes.  There are two things to note when pasting notes, however:

* Notes are pasted into the start of the bar that is shown in the piano roll editor when the notes are pasted.  Therefore you must position the window to start at the bar you want the notes to be placed into before pasting.
* The notes you've just pasted are not selected.

A further gotcha is:

* While you have the note movement tool active and notes are selected, any drag operation on the piano roll will move those notes, whether or not you start the drag inside the selection area or not.

This interface is planned to be improved and simplified in future versions of LMMS.

== Playback Control ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/3/31/Pianoroll-playbackcontrol.png <br> 
These have essentially the same function as the same tools in the [[0.4:Song Editor#Playback Controls|Song Editor]].

== Zoom ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/a3/Zoomsection.png <br> 
You can alter the size of a bar as displayed on screen by choosing a magnification from the zoom control. <br> 
You can also control the zoom level by holding down the ''Ctrl'' key and rolling the mouse wheel up or down.

== Quantisation ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/1/19/Pianoroll-quantisation.png <br> 
The current [[Glossary#quantisation|quantisation]] setting is displayed in a drop-down menu. <br> 
This allows you to set the minimum 'step' of the start or length of each note when recording, or when using the pencil tool.

== Note Length ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/b/be/Pianoroll-notelength.png <br> 
The current note length setting is displayed in another drop-down menu. <br> 
This controls the length of notes made with the creation tool. <br> 
You can either specify a given note length, or specify that the next note will be the same length as the last note.

== Note Volume (Velocity) ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/4/49/Pianoroll-note-volume.png <br> 
The 'weight' of each note - its loudness or softness - is termed '''velocity''' in music sequencers. <br> 
This velocity is shown as a vertical bar at the bottom of the window. <br> 
You can change the velocity of each note by clicking on this bar and dragging it to its preferred location. <br> 
This information is also recorded when you record notes from a MIDI keyboard that is capable of recording the velocity of the notes as they are played.

== Note Panning ==

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/7/74/Pianoroll-note-panning.png <br> 
Clicking on the note volume gives you the note panning and vice versa.
Here you can set the channel panning of each note, i.e. the position of the sound in the stereo field.

= Piano Keys =

Below the tool bar on the left-hand side of the window is the keyboard. <br> 
This shows a segment of a keyboard, seen side-on, that relates to the notes displayed in the piano roll.

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/a/ac/Pianoroll-keys.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

This can be scrolled up and down using the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the piano roll, or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse. <br> 
You can also click on this to play the corresponding note.


== Keyboard ==

[[File:keyboard-pianoKeys1.png|500px|thumb|right|keyboard as piano]]
You can use the keyboard of your computer to play notes in a two-octave range.  This starts from Z at C3 and goes horizontally across the bottom two rows of tke keyboard to M playing B3 - i.e. ZXCVBNM play the natural notes and SDGHJ play the sharps and flats.  It continues with Q playing C4 and uses the top two rows of the keyboard up to P playing E5 - i.e. QWERTYUIOP plays the natural notes and 2356790 play the sharps and flats.  In addition, any MIDI keyboard can be used to send MIDI command to this instrument when it's selected.
