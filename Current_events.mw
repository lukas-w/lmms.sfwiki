{{msgbox:out of date|0.4}}

= Current Events =

This is what the developers and community are currently working on.

= Developers =

The developers are now starting on the features for the 0.9 release.

= Editor =

The editor is now going through the manual and tagging pages as belonging to the manual for version 0.3 of LMMS.  This is done by adding the '' [ [ Category:0.3-manual ] ] '' category at the bottom of the page.  If the page is relatively simple to update to talk about LMMS 0.4 functionality, then it is done at that time and the page marked accordingly.

= Community involvement =

If you wish to be involved in any of these activities, please join in on the LMMS users or developers mailing lists or the IRC channel #lmms on Freenode.
