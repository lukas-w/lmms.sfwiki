LMMS is very configurable, with many settings allowing you to control how you interact with the software.  There are two main ways to work with these configuration parameters.

= Settings Dialog =

The main settings dialog is accessed through the '''Show settings dialog''' menu option in the '''Settings''' menu.  The window has a set of tabbed sections on the left and the settings for each on the right.  The first tab displayed is the general settings tab.

Most of the settings in the Settings Dialog do not take effect until you restart LMMS.

== General Settings ==

<!--{\end{center}}-->

*The '''Buffer Size''' slider controls the size of the audio processing buffer.  The display at the left of the control tells you the size of the buffer in frames and in milliseconds.  The longer the buffer, the less temporary peaks in CPU usage and interrupts from the rest of the operating system will affect the sound output.  However, the longer the buffer the more delay between when you make a change to a control and when that change is finally heard.  This affects both live performance and experimenting with the sound while composing.  It does not affect normal playback.

* The Misc set of radio buttons controls various miscellaneous settings:
** '''Disable Tooltips''' prevents moving the mouse over a control from popping up the small yellow tooltip for that control.  As the text explains, the CPU has to spend time popping up the tooltip and this may take processor time away from rendering the project in a live performance setting, causing breaks in the sound.  It is only likely to affect lower-end computers.
** '''Classical Knob Usability''' controls how clicking and dragging on a knob affects its value.  The 'classic' knob function is to turn it, so this would be performed using the mouse by making the pointer go in a circle around the knob.  The more typical function for computer use is to drag the control up or down vertically, ignoring any horizontal movement.  You may find one or the other more familiar to you.
** '''GIMP-like windows''' controls the layout of the actual LMMS window.  With this turned off, the standard MDI (Multiple Document Interface) functionality keeps all of LMMS's subwindows inside the main LMMS window.  Turning this on frees the subwindows, allowing them to move anywhere on the desktop and even onto other workspaces.  You may find either one of these easier to work with.
** '''Do not show wizard after upgrade/downgrade''' does pretty much what it says - when set, LMMS will not run the [[LMMS Settings#Setup Wizard|Setup Wizard]] again when you upgrade to a new version.  This may be useful for developers to turn off as they may be frequently changing the build of LMMS itself.
** '''Do not show message after showing this dialog''' again is self-descriptive.  Normally, LMMS will warn you after you change settings in the Settings Dialog that the changes will not take effect until you restart LMMS.  Turning this control on causes that warning not to appear.  You will still have to restart LMMS to get the changes to take effect, however.
** '''Display volume as dBV''' controls how instrument volume is displayed throughout LMMS.  Normally it is displayed in percentage - 100% is the normal setting.  This equates to 0 dBV.  Sound engineers may be more familiar with dBV settings.  For more information see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel#Voltage the WikiPedia article on Decibels].  This does not control the master volume setting as of version 0.3.1.
** '''Do not compress project files by default''' is another self-descriptive control.  LMMS's project files in uncompressed form have the ''.mmp'' extension, and when compressed they take the ''.mmpz'' extension.  There is no reason to leave project files uncompressed at this point in time.

== Directories ==

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

This tab allows you to set where files are loaded from and saved to.

* The '''Working''' directory is where your projects and saved presets are stored.  Projects are saved in a subdirectory named 'projects' and presets similarly.  You can put samples into a directory named 'samples' under the working directory and they will appear in the [[Side Bar]]'s samples section.  You can also use subdirectories in the samples directory to classify your samples; they will appear as folders in the side bar.  They will be listed separately from the default samples and presets that come with LMMS.
* The '''VST-plugin''' directory is used if you have VST plugins installed (e.g. under WINE).  Set this to the appropriate directory and your VST plugins will be available in LMMS.
* The '''Artwork''' directory is where themes for customising the look of LMMS can be stored.
* The '''FL Studio''' installation directory is used if you have Fruity Loops Studio&copy; installed.  Set this to the directory containing your copy of Fruity Loops Studio and when importing FLP-files, LMMS will try to load samples from the FL-installation-directory.
* The '''LADSPA Plugin''' directory is where [[LADSPA]] effects are installed.  If you have multiple locations, separate them with colons in the standard UNIX path manner.

== Performance Settings ==

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

The controls on this tab affect the speed of the rendering of your song into audio in relation to other parts of the interface.  While on most modern hardware rendering performance is not an issue, this may help people with older hardware use LMMS without gaps in playback.

*When the '''Disable channel activity indicators''' control is turned on, the activity indicators on each channel (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-settings-activity-off.png) do not activate whenever there is activity on that channel.  Normally, these glow orange and fade as each note is played per channel, and displaying this activity graphically can take up a reasonable amount of CPU time.
*When '''Only press keys on channel-piano manually''' is turned off, any open instrument plugin window will display the notes that it is playing on its piano keyboard, whether those be from actions by the user (e.g. on a MIDI keyboard) or during playback.  By turning this on, these note presses are only displayed from user input, thus saving an amount of CPU time.
*By setting the '''Number of CPUs''' to equal the number of processor cores in your system, you can get LMMS to take full advantage of your CPU power by distributing the sound rendering across the cores.  This allows slower multicore systems to play pieces that a single core may not be able to render.  However, setting this to greater than the number of cores in your system does not make better use of the system and may waste time switching between the rendering threads on one processor.
:You control this setting by dragging the number display up and down like a regular 'knob' control.

== Audio Settings ==

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/settings-dialog-audio.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

*The '''Audio Interface''' sets the mechanism that LMMS uses to produce audio.  You can select from:
** ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
** dummy (no sound output) - useful only for testing whether LMMS is functioning correctly.
** JACK (the Jack Audio Connection Kit)
** OSS (the Open Sound System)
** SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
:JACK is the most advanced of all these interfaces, but requires a working JACK daemon to connect to in order to function.  ALSA is the default and is standard on almost all modern Linux systems.  Support for PulseAudio may be coming in the future.
*With each interface, you can select the actual '''device''' and the number of '''channels''' used by LMMS.  These are interface-dependent settings and should be left at their defaults unless you have a good understanding of the interface in use on your computer.

== MIDI Settings ==

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

Similar to the Audio settings above, this allows you to select the interface to use to receive and send MIDI signals with your instruments.  Select the '''MIDI Interface''' that connects your computer to your MIDI instruments and set any device-specific '''Settings''' with these controls.

= Setup Wizard =

Alternatively, you can be guided through a series of steps that will configure the most commonly changed settings in your LMMS setup.  This is accessed through the '''Show settings dialog''' menu option in the '''Settings''' menu.  The wizard will also be shown to you the first time you start LMMS.  The wizard has a series of pages, starting with a welcome screen for the first step:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/settings-wizard-1.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

By clicking '''Next''' you will move to the next page, which asks you for the directory that LMMS will save your projects and presets in and look for your samples in.  This sets the '''working directory''' setting in the [[LMMS Settings#Directories|Settings Dialog]] above.

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

That's it!  You can now click '''Finish''' to save your settings or '''Cancel''' to cancel any changes.
