Here you can add things which could be displayed in a "tip of the day"-dialog in LMMS.

* You can use the sidebar on the left to get quick access to: plugins, projects, samples, presets, home and root folders
* You can create cool sounds turning BIT INVADER's sample length down a bit and then up again!
* There are many effects to choose from in the "FX" tab on any instrument.
* You can repeat patterns and piano-roll segments by holding down Ctrl before you drag a segment in the song or BB editor.
* You can change each track's colour in the Song Editor from its context menu.  This helps you group tracks together logically.
* If your instrument seems to 'click' when you release the note, try extending its decay or release time.
* You can click on the oscilloscope playback display in order to turn it off if you find it distracting.
* Once you've customised a sample or instrument to your tastes, it's a good idea to save it so that you can use it in other songs!
