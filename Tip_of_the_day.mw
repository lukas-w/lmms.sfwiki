Here you can add things which could be displayed in a "tip of the day"-dialog in LMMS.

* you can use the sidebar on the left to get quick access to: plugins, projects, samples, presets, home and root folders
* you can create cool sounds turning BIT INVADER's sample length down a bit and then up again!
* there are many effects to choose from in the "FX" tab on any instrument
