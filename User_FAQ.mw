This article describes frequently asked questions regarding usage of LMMS. '''If you have any problems please refer to [[Troubleshooting]].'''


== About ==

==== What is LMMS, anyway? ====
LMMS is a sound generation system which can generate both simple sounds, by means of software based signal generators, and complex music, by mixing and syncronizing those sounds into a rhythm. It truely gives you the opportunity to create music from begining to end. The tools to create the sounds, arrange the sounds and rhythms to create tracks, layer the tracks to create songs, and then save the songs to an output format are all there. Give it a try!

==== Is there anything commercial to which LMMS might be comparable? ====
LMMS seems to have much in common (at least in principle) with Apple's Garage Band, FL Studio (formerly Fruity Loops) and the like.


== Settings ==
==== I want to use another soundcard than the default one with LMMS. How to achieve this? ====
It's recommended to set your preferred audio-interface and it's parameters using the setup-dialog. If this doesn't work for some reason, you can also set the environment-variable "AUDIODEV" to what ever your audio-device is (e.g. ''/dev/dsp'' for OSS or ''surround40:1,0'' for ALSA).


== Usage ==

==== I made some piano chords in the Song-Editor but now I want to loop them. How to get them to the Beat+Bassline Editor? ====
for LMMS < 0.1.2:

First, drag the sound to the Beat+Bassline Editor by clicking just left or right of the button that indicates what kind of sound it is (for example: The button showing Triple Oscillator if it's a Triple Oscillator). That copies the sound to the Beat+Bassline Editor, but not the chords. Now open the chords in Piano-Roll, press Ctrl + A, Ctrl + C, open the Piano-Roll for the copied sound in the Beat+Bassline Editor, and press Ctrl + V. Now you can safely delete the bar in the Song-Editor and use the one in the Beat+Bassline Editor instead.

for LMMS >= 0.1.2
simply press <Ctrl> while dragging the according pattern onto the destination-pattern in Beat+Bassline-Editor. Of course you can do this in reverse direction too.


==== How do I create an instrument track in the Beat/Bassline Editor? ====
Open ''My Samples'' or ''My Presets'' (buttons on the far left side of the window) and double click on the instrument you want or right click it and select an appropriate action.


==== How do I change the note an instrument plays in the Beat/Bass Editor? ====
Click on the intrument button on the track. Thereâ€™s a blue bar just above the keyboard at the bottom, an orange square indicates the key that is played. Click on the blue bar to change the note.


==== How do I enable and adjust looping points? ====
Click on the enable/disable looppoints button in the song editor or pianoroll. It is disabled by default. Two blue arrows will appear in the upper tracking area of the window. You can adjust these loop points by rightclicking and dragging them or pressing middle and right button.


==== How do I Import a drums beat I'd made in Hydrogen? ====


==== How do I Import a MP3 or OGG file? ====


== Development ==
====  What is the compression format used to compress projects ? ====  

qCompress/qUncompress which itself uses libz. For decompressing projects, use 

 lmms -d inputfile.mmpz > output.mmp
