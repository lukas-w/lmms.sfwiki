The Triple Oscillator plugin is a synthesizer which generates sounds by combining the waveforms of up to three function generators.

== Plugin settings ==
The first panel controls the way the oscillators interact with each other. The available settings are:
* '''PM''' ('''Phase Modulation''') - phase of oscillator is modulated (i.e. phase locally changes left/right) by sub-oscillator.
* '''AM''' ('''Amplitude Modulation''') - output oscillator and its suboscillator is multiplied .
* '''Mix''' - The waveforms are added (default).
* '''Sync''' ('''Synchronized''') - The waveform of the first oscillator is restarted with the frequency of the second one (the waveform of the second one does not matter in this mode).
* '''FM''' ('''Frequency Modulation''') - frequency of oscillator is modulated (i.e. phase globally changes left/right) by sub-oscillator.
The next three panels are the settings for the three oscillators.
* The waveform generated (pictures).
* '''Vol (Volume)''' -  Amplitude of the waveform. Set to 0 when you don't want to use this oscillator.
* '''Pan (Panning)''' -  Affects the stereo panning of the oscillator.
* '''Crs (Coarse)''' -  Frequency of the oscillator relative to the note played in semitones.
* '''FL''' and '''FR''' - Fine-tuning of the frequency for the left and right stereo channel.
* '''PO (Phase Offset)''' -  Phase offset of the waveform relative to the other oscillators.
* '''SPD (Stereo Phase Offset)''' -  Phase offset between left and right stereo channel.

== Waveforms ==
;Sine: The "purest" sound. Useful for organ-like instruments. Due to a sine wave being only one exact frequency, normal frequency filters have little effect on sine waves.
;Triangle: Similar to sine, although a lot less smooth.  Useful for string instruments.
;Sawtooth: A very sharp, "synth-like" sound.  Useful for string instruments and generic "synth-like" instruments.
;Square(Pulse): The typical sound of vintage arcade games. Sounds much less old-fashioned when combined with other waveforms.  Be cautious, as the square wave will sound a lot louder than the other waves.
;Moog-like saw: Sounds similar to saw, but can also be used for some organ-like sounds.  The shape is due to a historic glitch in the analogue circuitry of the original Moog synthesizer.
;Exponential: If used correctly, it can be used for softer synths.
;White Noise: Useful for creating drum beats and other effects like wind (You might prefer to use [[Kicker]] for synthesized percussion instruments).
;User-defined: Double-click to use any sound file as a waveform.

==Tips==
* The best results are reached by combining different waveforms with different chorus settings.
* Most sounds created by a triple oscillator sound boring and dull without an [[0.4:Working_with_Instruments#Envelope_basics|Envelope]].
* See [[0.4:Making Triple-Oscillator Patches|Making Triple Oscillator Patches]] for further tips for getting the most out of this plugin.
