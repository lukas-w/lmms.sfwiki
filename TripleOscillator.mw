The Triple Oscillator plugin is a synthesizer which generates sounds by combining the waveforms of up to three function generators.

== Plugin settings ==
The first panel controls the way the oscillators interact with each other. The available settings are:
* '''Phase Modulation''' - phase of oscillator is modulated (i.e. phase locally changes left/right) by sub-oscillator
* '''Amplitude Modulation''' - output oscillator and its suboscillator is multiplied 
* '''Mixed''' - The waveforms are added (default)
* '''Synchronized''' - The waveform of the first oscillator is restarted with the frequency of the second one (The waveform of the second one does not matter in this mode)
* '''Frequency Modulation''' - frequency of oscillator is modulated (i.e. phase globally changes left/right) by sub-oscillator
The next three panels are the settings for the three oscillators.
* The waveform generated
* '''Vol''' - (Volume) Amplitude of the waveform. Set to 0 when you don't want to use this oscillator.
* '''Pan''' - (Panning) Affects the stereo panning of the oscillator.
* '''Crs''' - (Coarse) Frequency of the oscillator relative to the note played in semitones
* '''FL''' and '''FR''' - Fine-tuning of the frequency for the left and right stereo channel
* '''PO''' - (Phase Offset) Phase offset of the waveform relative to the other oscillators
* '''SPD''' - (Stereo Phase Offset) Phase offset between left and right stereo channel

== Waveforms ==
;Sine: The "purest" sound. Useful for organ-like instruments. Due to their physical properties frequency filters have no effect on sine waves.
;Triangle: Similar to sine, although a lot less smooth.  Useful for string instruments
;Sawtooth: A very sharp, "synth-like" sound.  Useful for string instruments and generic "synth-like" instruments.
;Pulse/Square wave: The typical sound of vintage arcade games. Sounds much less old-fashioned when combined with other waveforms.  Be cautious, as the square wave will sound a lot louder than the other waves.
;Moog-like Triangle: Sounds similar to saw, but can also be used for some organ-like sounds.
;Exponential Wave: If used correctly, it can be used for softer synths.
;Noise: Useful for creating drum beats and other effects like wind (You might prefer to use [[Kicker]] for synthesized percussion instruments).
;User-defined: Double-click to use any sound file as a waveform.

==Tips==
* The best results are reached by combining different waveforms with different chorus settings.
* Most sounds created by a triple oscillator sound boring and dull without an [[Working_with_Instruments#Envelope_basics|Envelope]].
* See [[Making Triple-Oscillator patches]] for further tips for getting the most out of this plugin.
