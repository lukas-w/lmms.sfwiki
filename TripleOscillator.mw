The Triple Oscillator plugin is a synthesizer which generates sounds by combining the waveforms of up to three function generators.

== Plugin settings ==
The first panel controls the way the oscillators interact with each other. The available settings are:
* '''Phase Modulation''' 
* '''Amplitude Modulation'''
* '''Mixed''' - The waveforms are added (default)
* '''Synchronized''' - The waveform of the first oscillator is restarted with the frequency of the second one (The waveform of the second one does not matter in this mode)
* '''Frequence Modulation'''
The next three panels are the settings for the three oscillators.
* The waveform generated
* '''Vol''' - (Volume) Amplitude of the waveform. Set to 0 when you don't want to use this oscillator.
* '''Pan''' - (Panning) Affects the stereo panning of the oscillator.
* '''Crs''' - (Chorus) Frequency of the oscillator relative to the note played in semitones
* '''FL''' and '''FR''' - Fine-tuning of the frequency for the left and right stereo channel
* '''PO''' - (Phase Offset) Phase offset of the waveform relative to the other oscillators
* '''SPD''' - (Stereo Phase Offset) Phase offset between left and right stereo channel

== Waveforms ==
;Sine: The "purest" sound. Useful for organ-like instruments. Due to their physical properties frequency filters have no effect on sine waves.
;Triangle:
;Sawtooth: Useful for string instruments.
;Pulse wave: The typical sound of vintage arcade games. Sounds much less old-fashioned when combined with other waveforms.
;Moog-like Triangle:
;Exponential Wave:
;Noise: Useful for creating snare drums (You might prefer to use [[Kicker]] for synthesized percussion instruments).
;User-defined: Double-click to use any sound file as a waveform.

==Tips==
* The best results are reached by combining different waveforms with different chorus settings.
* Most sounds sounds created by a triple oscillator sound boring and dull without an [[Envelope]].
