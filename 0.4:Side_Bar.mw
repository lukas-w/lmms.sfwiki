{{0.4:Side BarTrans}}

The Side Bar is permanently attached to the left-hand side of the window.  It has two modes, retracted and extended.  In retracted mode it looks like this:

<!--{\end{center}}-->

It has six sections that provide easy access to the variety of files and presets that you will use in LMMS.  When you click on any one section label, the side bar will extend and show you the contents of that section.

When you click on the Instrument Plugin button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/sidebar-retracted-plugin.png), the sidebar expands to show you the available instrument plugins:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

By default, no instrument plugin is selected.  When you hover the mouse over one, its box will expand to include a description of the plugin in question, like so:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

You can then drag an instrument plugin to either the [[Song Editor]] or the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]], or double-click an instrument plugin label to add it directly to the Beat + Bassline Editor.

----

In all sections but the Instrument Plugins section, the listing you get functions like a directory tree listing.  Folders are marked with an folder icon.  If you double-click on a folder, it opens and displays its contents indented to the right of the folder name.  To close it again, double-click on the folder name again.

These folders match the directories on your own computer, allowing you a convenient way to group sounds and presets both on your hard disk and in LMMS.

= My Projects =
Is the 2. option in the sidebar.
You get a shortcut to the project folder-browser.
Depending on your user-created subfolders, there will be a browser-tree.
Loading a project is simple. Just double-click on the name of the project you like to load. Wait for the project to load ''completely'', before using other features in LMMS!

Observe the small input-field in the bottom. This makes it possible for you to find a project with token search. Just enter a few characters from the project disk-name, and the smart-search in LMMS will filter the projects in the folder that is highlighted.

Right next to the input-field there is an update-button. If you cant find your latest project, press this button. The tree will collapse, and all folders are updated.

There are 2 more buttons for accessing projects. Both are in the top speedbar.

The 3. speedbar button points to the projects-folder, and will open a project-browser.
The 4. speedbar button will open a listing of recently opened projects.
