{{0.4:Side BarTrans}}

The Side Bar is permanently attached to the left-hand side of the window.  It has 2 modes: retracted and extended. In retracted mode it looks like this:

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| width="50px" style="color: #000" valign="top"|
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/9/97/Sidebar.png
| style="color: #000" valign="middle"|

It has 6 sections that provide easy access to the various '''elements''' (instruments, samples, files, and presets) that you will use in LMMS. When you click on any one section label, the side bar will extend and show you the contents of that section. Click the section label again to retract the bar.

= Instrument Plugins =

When you click on the Instrument Plugin button http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/sidebar-retracted-plugin.png, the sidebar expands to show you the available instrument plugins:

By default, no instrument plugin is selected. When you hover the mouse over one, its box will expand to include a description of the plugin:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/0/0e/Sidebar1-instrumentplugins-info.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

You can then drag an instrument plugin to either the [[0.4:Song Editor|Song Editor]] or the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]], or double-click an instrument plugin label to add it directly to the Beat + Bassline Editor.

= Navigation =

In all sections except for the Instrument Plugins section, the listing you get functions like a directory tree listing.  Folders are marked with an folder icon.  If you click in the check-box to the left of the folder-icon, the folder opens and displays its contents indented to the right of the folder name.  To close it again, click the check-box again.

These folders match the directories on your own computer, allowing you a convenient way to group sounds and presets both on your hard disk and in LMMS.

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| width="300px" style="color: #000" valign="top"|
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/1/1b/Sidebar-search.png
| style="color: #000" valign="middle"|

Open folders can be smart-searched. 
For this you use the small input-field in the bottom.<br>
This makes it possible for you to find an item with token search.<br> 
Just enter a few characters from the items disk-name, and the smart-search in LMMS will filter the items in the folder that is open.<br> 
'''Smart-search does ''not'' search subfolders!'''

Next to the input-field there is an update-button. <br> 
If you can't find your latest item, click this button, all folders are updated and the tree will collapse, so this is also an convenient way to close all open folders.

Lets take a closer look at the tabs.

= My Projects =

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| width="300px" style="color: #000" valign="top"|
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/50/Sidebar2-myprojects.png
| style="color: #000" valign="middle"|

The 2nd option in the sidebar; a shortcut to the project folder-browser.<br> 
Depending on your user-created subfolders, there will be a browser-tree. <br> 
Double-click on the name of the project you want to load. <br> 
Wait for the project to load ''completely'', before using other features in LMMS! <br> 
|}

The next 2 tabs on the side-bar contain your instruments. They are the Samples and the Instruments. Both have similar behavior.

= Samples =

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| width="300px" style="color: #000" valign="top"|
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/65/Sidebar3-mysamples.png
| style="color: #000" valign="middle"|

Samples or MySamples as the tab is named, gives you easy access to LMMS samples collection. <br> 
Samples can be either WAV or OGG sound files. You have smart-search and can update the display. <br> 
To preview the sample, '''left-click and hold''' on its name. <br>
Drag the sample to the Song-Editor or the Beat+Bassline-Editor to add it as a new track. When you drag-and-drop a sample into either editor, the new track will be added at the bottom of the track list. You can drag the grip dots on the left end of the track to move the track to where you want it in the track list. <br>
Double-click the sample to add it to the Beat+Bassline-Editor as a new track. <br> 
The mouse cursor symbol will show a null sign as you drag if the sample can't be dropped into that window. <br> 

|}

= Presets =

{| cellspacing="0" valign="top" align="center" width="100%"
| width="300px" style="color: #000" valign="top"|
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/1/14/Sidebar4-mypresets.png
| style="color: #000" valign="middle"|

Presets or MyPresets as the tab is named, gives you easy access to a collection of predefined instruments. <br> 
Presets are Instrument plugins with specific settings that make them sound nice :). <br> 
You have smart-search and can update the display. <br> 
'''''Warning''''': you should make it a habit to save your project '''''before''''' you preview a preset (i.e. before you '''left-click and hold''' on a preset), because sometimes preview can crash LMMS. This is particularly important before previewing a VeSTige preset! <br> 
Drag the preset to the Song-Editor or the Beat+Bassline-Editor to add it as a new track. If you drag a preset into (i.e. on top of) an existing preset in either of the editors, it will replace the previous preset. Otherwise, when you drag-and-drop a preset into either editor, the new track will be added at the bottom of the track list. You can drag the grip dots on the left end of the track to move the track to where you want it in the track list.  <br> 
Double-click the preset to add it to the Beat+Bassline-Editor as a new track. <br>
The mouse cursor symbol will show a null sign as you drag if the preset can't be dropped into that window.

= My Home =
The 5th tab in the sidebar, My Home is a shortcut to a specific folder on your system. On Windows systems this corresponds to the %HOMEPATH% folder (i.e. the current user's profile) containing folders such as Desktop, Favorites, MyDocuments, etc.

= My Computer =
The last tab on the side-bar is a shortcut to the root of your computer's folder tree. You can browse the tree and even use token-search. Quite handy for general purposes.
