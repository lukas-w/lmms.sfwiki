BEING UPDATED TO 0.4

The main menu bar gives you various options to control the overall functioning of LMMS:

= Project Menu =

The Project menu allows you to load, save and export projects and import MIDI files.

* '''New''' creates a new project.

* '''Open''' gives you a dialog to choose an existing project file to open.

* '''Recently opened Projects''' opens up a submenu listing all the recent project files you have opened, so that you can easily open a project you were recently working on.  This does not include a project that you have just created and saved, so you have to open the project at least once before it will show up in this menu.

* '''Save''' saves the current project if it has already been saved.  If not it functions as if you had chosen 'Save as'.

* '''Save As''' gives you a dialog to choose a (new) location and name to save your project in.

* '''Import''' allows you to import MIDI and other files as new instrument lines.

* '''Export''' allows you to export your song as an uncompressed WAV file or compressed OGG file.  No MP3 file export support is planned.  Once you have chosen a name and location to save the file, you then get presented with a dialog:

: This allows you to choose the format of the file and, for OGG files, the bit rate and bit rate management method (these settings are ignored for WAV files).  Please note that, at this stage, the format chosen here and the extension you used on the file in the export file dialog are not synchronised automatically - you must set them the same manually to end up with a file which is named correctly for its content.  You can also choose whether to use the [[Tool Bar#Sound_Quality_Controls|High Quality Mode]] when performing the song.

: On pressing 'OK' the song will be performed from where the playback point was last set.  To get the entire song exported you should check that the playback mark is at the start of the song before exporting it.

* '''Quit''' exits LMMS.  You will be asked if you want to save your project if you have done any work on it since the last save or since you created it.

= Edit Menu =

The first two options in this menu are '''Undo''' and '''Redo'''.  These can be also accessed by pressing the common keys Ctrl-Z and Shift-Ctrl-Z, respectively.  They allow you to step backward, or forward, through a history of edits to your project, reversing mistaken actions or re-applying them.

In this version the undo feature only works correctly for some forms of editing.  In particular, in the [[Piano Roll Editor]] the bulk move, copy and paste facilities using the selection tool and/or clipboard do not get undone or redone correctly.  The developers are aware of this problem and are working on a fix in a future version.

The third option is '''Settings''', which opens the [[0.4:LMMS Settings|Settings dialog]].

= Tools Menu =

The only option currently in this menu is the '''LADSPA Plugin Browser'''.  The [[LADSPA Plugin Browser]] can be used to view information about available LADSPA Plugins, and the alike.

= Help Menu =

There are three items in the Help menu.

* '''Help''' opens the wiki's [[Main Page]]
* '''What's This?''' changes your cursor into a help cursor.  When you click on any part of a LMMS window, you will then see the contextual help for this item.  Much of the help is in place but some items are still awaiting text being written for them.
* '''About''' gives you a dialog which lists the LMMS project's version, its home page, its key developers, translation information if you are using LMMS in a language other than English, and the GNU GPL license that the software is released under.
