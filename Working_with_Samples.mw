= Samples =

Samples are simply recorded audio in compressed or uncompressed form.  They can be almost anything, from someone singing or playing a real instrument or an atmospheric recorded effect to the sound of a hand-clap, drum beat or percussion hit.  Samples can be used in three fundamental ways - either played as a sound in their own right, played as an instrument, or played as percussion.

= Samples as sounds =

A sample treated just as a sound means that you want to play the sample back at exactly the same pitch and speed it was recorded at.  You can put the sample in an [[AudioFileProcessor Plugin]] [[Instrument]] in the [[Song Editor]] and then create a note in the [[Piano Roll Editor]] that is the length of the sample.  This can take some experimentation to stretch the note out to the length of the sample.  By doing this you are also limited to playing only one sample on this track.  There is an easier way.

In the [[Song Editor]], you can use the '''Add Sample Track''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1-songeditor-button-new-sampletrack.png) to create a track that plays samples.  Click on the sample track timeline to create a new segment for a sample.  You can then add a sample into that segment by either double-clicking on the segment (which will display a File Open dialog for you to choose the sample to be played) or by dragging a sample from the Side Bar into the segment.  The sample will be played in that segment and the segment will expand to take up the entire length of the sample.  You can further crop the segment shorter (to clip sound off the end) by dragging the end of the sample left or right.  All the regular actions of the song editor apply to samples.

The Sample Track also allows you to play several different samples in the same track.  This is useful if you have recorded a chorus, solo and bridge separately (for example) and want to combine them into the same track.  Simply create more than one segment and drop your samples into this.

You can also overlap samples and they will play simultaneously rather than one occluding the other.  However, there is no indication in the sample of where the overlaps are, so even though you can put one sample completely over another you will not be able to see the sample underneath unless you actually move the top sample.  This can be confusing and is not recommended.

Unlike other editors, these tracks are stereo by default.  If you have two mono recordings for the left and right channel and want to include them as a stereo pair, you can add them individually into separate sample tracks.  At the moment there is no way to pan each track left or right, however.  You may be better off at this stage combining the two tracks into one stereo track in your favourite audio editor.
