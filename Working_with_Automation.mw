Automation is a powerful tool for customising the sound of your project.  It can provide anything from a simple 'automated' mixing desk - moving the volume levels up and down as the song progresses - to changing the sound of an instrument, its effects settings, and even the tempo of the entire song.  Virtually [[Automation#What_can_be_automated.3F|any control]] can be automated, allowing for very powerful control of your song.

The list of controls that can be automated is vast, as can be seen from the list in the [[Automation#What_can_be_automated.3F|Automation Editor reference]].  However, it is worth looking at this list in more detail to see the sheer quantity of controls that can be automated:

* Track controls such as the Volume and Mute settings, in both the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]] and the [[Piano Roll Editor]].
* Virtually all Instrument controls:
** The settings of the Instrument [[Plugins|Plugin]] itself, worthy of a subsection in its own right:
*** All the knobs, such as phase, tuning, and pan.
*** All the multivalue selectors, such as the waveform shape of each oscillator and even the mix type between them.
** The knobs controlling the envelope, LFO and filter parameters.
** The radio buttons controlling the filter and LFO.
** The type of filter selected.
** The arpeggio type and length.
** The controls for any effects you've got on the instrument, and whether all effects are on or not.
** The MIDI channels to receive and send note data on.
* The master Tempo, Pitch and Volume.

Basically, right-click on it, and if it's got an 'Open in Automation Editor' option in the context menu, it's automatable!

Let's look at some examples of how to use automation in your songs.

== Fading in ==

== Adding expression ==

By automating the master tempo control to get slower (a ''rallentando'') as you approach the end of a phrase and then resume its pace immediately after, you give your piece expression - as if a live piano player were emphasising that section.  This looks somewhat like a single 'negative' sawtooth taken out of the automation, such as
