=== Anonymous SVN ===

If you want to access SVN for downloading the latest unstable '''developer''' version, you do the following:

 svn co https://lmms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lmms/trunk/lmms lmms

For getting the latest stable version, do the following:

 svn co https://lmms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lmms/branches/lmms/stable-0.4 lmms

Afterwards you have a directory ''lmms'' in your current directory which contains a complete source-directory. Before you continue, make sure you've cmake installed! Then change into directory "lmms" and type
 cmake .
(note the dot after command, it tells cmake to operate on current directory)


Now you can configure and build LMMS the usual way or see [[Installation|Installation tutorial]] for details on how to proceed.


If you want to update your SVN-checkout simply type

 svn up

inside lmms-directory


=== SVN with your SF.net-account ===

Of course you can use your SF.net-account for checking out a local working-copy to work on. If you're a registered developer of LMMS, you'll also be able to commit your changes.

 svn co https://lmms.svn.sf.net/svnroot/lmms/trunk/lmms --username=YOUR_SF_NET_NICK


=== WebSVN ===

For browsing the SVN-repository in an easy way you can also use the [http://lmms.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lmms/trunk/ WebSVN] of LMMS.
