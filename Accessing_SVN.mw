== Accessing SVN ==

=== Anonymous SVN ===

If you want to access SVN for downloading the latest version, you do the following:

 svn co https://lmms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lmms/trunk/lmms

Afterwards you have a directory ''lmms'' in your current directory which contains a complete source-directory. Before you continue, make sure you've automake-, autoconf- and libtool-packages installed! Then change into directory "lmms" and type
 make -f Makefile.svn</code>
Now you can configure and build LMMS the usual way or see [[documentation:installation|Installation tutorial]] for details on how to proceed.


If you want to update your SVN-checkout simply type

 svn up

inside lmms-directory


=== SVN with your SF.net-account ===

Of course you can use your SF.net-account for checking out a local working-copy to work on. If you're a registered developer of LMMS, you'll also be able to commit your changes.

 svn co https://lmms.svn.sf.net/svnroot/lmms/trunk/lmms --username=YOUR_SF_NET_NICK


=== WebSVN ===

For browsing the SVN-repository in an easy way you can also use the [[http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lmms/trunk/|WebSVN]] of LMMS.
