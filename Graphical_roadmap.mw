Here's graphical todo list the way I see it (Vesa):

General

- simplify and modernize the visual style

- create a consistent, balanced palette 

- fix flaws eg. blurriness, pixelation 

- use different colours for automation & instrument tracks, decide on a colour for each 


Plugin artwork

- SF2 player: revamp the artwork 

- LB302: fix logo, retouch artwork? 

- triple osc: maybe redo logo, increase conrast, retouch? most used plugin, deserves some attention

- organic: spice up ui, maybe redo logo? 


Icons

- redo all/most icons to give a consistent, clean style that fits the new palette

- replace/redo all icons that are blurry, eg. bb editor icon must go

- automation & instrument track icons should match the tracks

- bb track icons should match the bb editor


UI elements

- redraw all knobs, retouch leds

- redo transport buttons (consistency

- fx leds to match new palette
