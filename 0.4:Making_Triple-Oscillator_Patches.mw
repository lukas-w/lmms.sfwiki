{{0.4:Making Triple-Oscillator PatchesTrans}}

If you find all your instruments sounding like an Atari 2600 (unless that's what you were going for), these guidelines for creating patches that sound like familiar musical instruments or sounds will help you.  These instructions are intentionally a bit vague, so you can easily adapt them to the type of music you want to write.  When making patches, it often helps to have a [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|BB track]] playing the sound over and over as you edit.

When creating instruments with different generators, not just TripleOscillator patches, there are a few unwanted events that may occur. The most frequent problem is 'clicks'.
The instrument sounds pretty much ok, but there's a distinct 'click' artifact every time the note plays. Clicks are annoying, but most can be easily removed. The start-event clicks are the easiest. 
*Open the ENV for VOLUME.
*Set AMT to maximum.
*Set ATTACK to just a little over 0 (try 0.04)
Listen to the sound. If your click artifact didn't change a little, then the click is from the 'termination' of the sound. Here the situation is more difficult.
You may be able to remove the click by giving REL <= 0.05.
Another annoying problem is 'noisy crater' randomly occurring in longer notes.
This is often caused by too high Q in respect of either the cutoffFrq or the actual chosen filter. These type of artifacts can be seriously difficult to remove without changing the quality of the sound. Often success versus fiasco depends on minute alterations in Q.

If you are not familiar with terms like LFO, filters and resonance-Q amount, you should now go to the section [[0.4:Working with Instruments]] and read the [[0.4:Working with Instruments#The Env/LFO/Filter tab|paragraph ''The Env/LFO/Filter tab'']]. All the basics (and more) are explained there.

= Synth bass =
We'll start with your basic synthesized techno bass sound, because this is a relatively simple patch to start learning your way around the Triple-Oscillator.
Start with a fresh Triple-Oscillator with the default sine-wave patch.  
*  Start on the "PLUGIN" page and change the waveforms.  Try some different combinations: a square, a triangle and a sine wave are a good combo, or set them all to saw or moog-saw.
*  Select the "ENV/LFO" page.  Turn the filter on to "LowPass", "2x LowPass" or "Moog" and turn the cutoff all the way down.  Your sound becomes almost inaudible.
*  Go to the "CUTOFF" subpage and turn the envelope on.  Turn "Hold", "Sustain" and "Release" to zero.  Hear the filter now?
*  Now start playing with the resonance knob in the "FILTER" section.  If you're using the Moog filter, don't turn the resonance past about 0.85 - you've been warned!
*  Now play some really low notes.

= Organ =
Real organs are basically additive synthesizers: they add together a few dozen simple sine waves to form a complex tone. This is pretty easy to mimic with the Triple-Oscillator and LMMS's chords.
*  Start with a fresh sine patch, and using each oscillator's "Crs" (coarse) knobs, place them in 3 different octaves.
*  Go to the "FUNC" page and turn on chords.  Set the chord to "Octave" and set "RANGE" to 3 or 4.  Neat, eh?
*  Play different C's.  They sound similar, don't they?  That's because most of the harmonics are the same.
*  For some fun, change one of the oscillators to a triangle wave.
*  You can refine the sound by changing which octaves each oscillator plays in, or by adjusting their relative volumes.

= Electric bass =
Electric bass guitars produce a wide variety of tones.  This is just your basic bass with no overdrive or anything like that.
*  Start with a sine patch and mute OSC 1.  Turn OSC 2's volume to 100%.
*  Set "OSC 2 + OSC 3" to PM (Phase Modulation)
*  Turn on the volume envelope and give it a long decay, very short release and an attack around 1/50 or 1/20 of a second.
*  Go to the "FX" page and add a TAP Chorus/Flanger effect.  This adds an extra layer of richness to the sound.
*  Now, go back to the "PLUGIN" page and decide where you want OSC 3's volume (that is, the amount of phase modulation between OSC 3 and OSC 2).
*  Finally, reinforce the fundamental (lowest harmonic) of your sound by turning OSC 1 up just a bit. This is optional. Or you can use a triangle wave. Whatever, it's your sound.
