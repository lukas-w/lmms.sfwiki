The hardware and software required to run LMMS is reasonably modest.

= Hardware =

== CPU/RAM ==
Depending on the type and size of the songs you plan to write it's recommended to have at least 1 GHz and 512 MB of RAM. If you use VST-plugins and a recent SVN-copy of LMMS it's also recommended to have multiple cores and/or CPUs.

== Soundcard ==
There're no special needs. LMMS will run with an ordinary cheap 2-channel soundcard but it can also make use of surround-soundcards! Furthermore a MIDI-port should not be missing if you plan to record your MIDI keyboard with LMMS.

= Software =

For running LMMS you need Linux (Debian or Ubuntu recommended). Detailed requirements and recommendations can be found at [[Installation#Resolving_dependencies|Resolving dependencies]].
