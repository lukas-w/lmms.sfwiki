The hardware and software required to run LMMS is reasonably modest.

== CPU/RAM ==
Depending on the type and size of the songs you plan to write it's recommended to have at least 1 GHz and 512 MB of RAM. If you use [[Tested VSTs|VST-plugins]] and a recent SVN-copy of LMMS it's also recommended to have multiple cores and/or CPUs.

== Soundcard ==
There are no special needs. LMMS will run with an ordinary cheap 2-channel soundcard but it can also make use of surround-soundcards! Furthermore you will need a MIDI port if you plan to use your [[Using MIDI|MIDI keyboard]] to record or play back from LMMS.

== Operating Systems ==

LMMS is tested and available on the following platforms:

* Linux
* Windows
* OS X

== Navigation ==
