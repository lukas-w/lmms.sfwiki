This is meant to be a very basic tutorial on how to install LMMS.

= http://gsmartcontrol.berlios.de/home/images/os_icons/windows.png Installation under Windows =

Download the win32.exe file from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/lmms/files/lmms/

Run it, and follow the installation instructions.

'''Please note that many distributions only ship outdated versions of LMMS (0.3.x or even older!). It's strongly advised against using these old versions as they're rather unstable and feature-incomplete compared to the current 0.4.x series!'''


== http://gsmartcontrol.berlios.de/home/images/os_icons/fedora.png Fedora ==

LMMS is now available in the standard Fedora updates repository.  If you wish to use VST plugins, you will need to install the ''lmms-vst'' package as well as the ''lmms'' package.

Just go to: ''System''/''Administration''/''Add''/''Remove Software'' to choose these packages.


== http://gsmartcontrol.berlios.de/home/images/os_icons/gentoo.png Gentoo ==

LMMS is now avaible for Gentoo in the official portage tree.

So, Gentoo users who want to install LMMS only have to do:

 # echo "media-sound/lmms **" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
 # emerge -av lmms


== http://gsmartcontrol.berlios.de/home/images/os_icons/ubuntu.png Ubuntu ==
* '''11.04 Natty Narwhal''': lmms-0.4.10 is in the Ubuntu Software Centre.
* '''10.10 Maverick Meerkat''': lmms-0.4.5 is in the Ubuntu Software Centre.

For more current versions, install from one of the PPAs:

To install the latest version of LMMS on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic), open Ubuntu Software Centre and search for "LMMS".


<font color="#ff0000">*It has been reported that LMMS does not work "out of the box" using its Alsa driver in Ubuntu-9.10 (Karmic)*</font>

Thus below is a tutorial on how to get LMMS working using the alsa driver.


1. First we need to find the name/number of our soundcard. To do so, open a terminal window and enter:
 aplay -l ; arecord -l


-the output should be something like this...

<font color=blue>
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
 card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC268 Analog [ALC268 Analog]
  Subdevices: 0/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
 **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
 card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC268 Analog [ALC268 Analog]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0</font>

from "device" we can see 0 , so this should equate to hw:0   (there may be other options e.g. plughw:)

-Another method of finding your soundcard's details is:
 cat /proc/asound/cards 
mine gives: 
<font color=blue>
 0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel
                      HDA Intel at 0x78540000 irq 16</font>

this also shows '''card 0''', and the name '''"Intel"''' which can be passed to step (5) below as '''plughw:Intel''' , with all other steps remaining the same.


2. Now in terminal type
 gksu gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa 

and change the lines ...  
<font color=blue>
                          #load-module module-alsa-sink
                          #load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0</font>
to..........
<font color=blue>
                          load-module module-alsa-sink <font color=green>device=hw:x</font>
                          load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:<font color=green>x</font></font>
(remember to uncomment #)

(where '''x''' is the card '''#number''', this can also be '''hw:x,x''' you will have to experiment a bit, though mostly it will be '''hw:0''' for the internal soundcard)


3. You will now need to reboot for these changes to take effect and to continue the rest of the changes required.


4. Open the "Multimedia System Selector" either through the gui under System > Preferences, or with the command gstreamer-properties by using the terminal. Now change both input & output plugin: to "pulseaudio" and device: to the line containing "hw:0" (or whatever your result was from (1) which will be something like... pulsesink device="alsa_output.hw_0" and pulsesrc device="alsa_input.hw_0


5. Open LMMS and go to > edit > settings > audio (speaker icon) and change "audio interface" to "Alsa"(if not already) and below that change where it says "settings for Alsa" > Default, to the audio device name from step (1) e.g. '''hw:0'''

6. Restart LMMS, and hopefully you'll be good to go, (you may/will have to use "gstreamer-properties" to change the device back to default when you are not using LMMS, to be able to hear any other audio streams though)

Ubuntu Jaunty comes with an old version of LMMS (0.4.2). To install the latest version of LMMS on Ubuntu Jaunty, run the command below:

 sudo wget https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/29948/jaunty.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tobydox.list && sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ADDE29B2 && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install lmms ubuntustudio-plugins lmms-vst

To install LMMS manually for Intrepid and Hardy, please take a look at [https://launchpad.net/~tobydox/+archive/ppa Tobydox' Personal Package Archive].


* If you want to try the latest UNSTABLE branch, run this command instead. Please note that the LMMS developers do not support this version as it is unfinished:

 sudo wget https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/29948/winejaunty.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list && sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 387EE263 && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install libqt4-dev libflac++6 flac libflac++-dev qt4-dev-tools git-core build-essential libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libjack0.100.0-dev libjackasyn-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev ubuntustudio-audio-plugins libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libvorbis-dev libvorbisfile3 libvorbisenc2 libsamplerate0-dev libstk0-dev stk libfftw3-dev libfluidsynth-dev git wine wine-dev cmake && mkdir lmms-install && cd lmms-install && git clone git://lmms.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/lmms/lmms && cd lmms && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr && make && sudo make install && cd && rm -r lmms-install

* Compiling LMMS for the first time requires a download of roughly 115mb, including dependencies and other packages. Without dependencies , it requires a download of around 23mb.
* This command adds the winehq repository for the latest version of wine and wine-dev, required for VST support.
