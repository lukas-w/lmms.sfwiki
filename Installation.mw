This is meant to be a very basic and linear tutorial on how to install LMMS.

= Installation under various distributions =

== Gentoo Linux ==

LMMS is now avaible for Gentoo in the "semi-official" overlay www.gentoo-sunrise.org.

So, Gentoo users who want to install LMMS only have to do:

 # emerge -va layman
 # echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf
 # layman -f -a sunrise
 # echo "media-sound/lmms ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
 # emerge -av lmms

This ebuild stills experimental and no-official so bugs shouldn't be reported on Gentoo's Bugzilla unless it's a problem with the ebuild and you write a patch (you can report this patch at bugs.gentoo.org on bug 100170). If you have any other problem with it, please contact me: cooldwind at gmail dot com.

== Fedora ==

Fedora has version 0.3.2 of LMMS available in the Planet CCRMA repository [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetccrma/].  After installing the yum repository for Planet CCRMA, then execute:

  yum install lmms

And then yum should resolve all your dependencies and install the software for you.

= Installing LMMS from SVN =

Examples provided assume you're running Debian GNU/Linux.

* First you need to get LMMS sources from the SVN repository, or update your sources, if you're upgrading from a previous version. The following command will checkout a recent SVN-copy of in a newly created folder named "lmms" in the current dir.
 svn co https://lmms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lmms/branches/lmms stable-0.4
* Then you have to configure LMMS: cd into the "stable-0.4" directory and run CMake
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
* resolve any unmet dependencies (see section "[[Installation#Resolving_dependencies|Resolving dependencies]]" below for more on this topic)
* Now compile LMMS:
 make
** People with more than one CPU core can use make's -j option to compile some files in parallel.  For instance:
 make -j 2
* Finally you can install LMMS by running as root
 sudo make install


== Resolving dependencies ==

To compile LMMS from sources you need several development libraries, from graphical to sound ones. Some are essential and some are optional.

=== Required libraries ===

* Qt >= 4.3 libs + development files
** under Debian based distributions run
 aptitude install libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools
* sound file library - for reading and writing files containing sampled audio data
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libsndfile1-dev''

Next you need to allow LMMS to communicate with your audio hardware, so you have to choose one or more of the following setups and provide corresponding development libraries:
* [http://www.alsa-project.org/ ALSA] - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture - apart from libs and -dev libs, you need ALSA modules for your soundcard (built-in with 2.6.x kernels) and those modules loaded - see [http://www.alsa-project.org/ http://www.alsa-project.org/] and [http://alsa.opensrc.org/ http://alsa.opensrc.org/] for info
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libasound2-dev''
* [http://jackaudio.org/ JACK] - Jack Audio Connection Kit - a low latency audio server that allows the connection of multiple applications to an audio device (typically an ALSA one), as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libjack0.100.0-dev libjackasyn-dev''
* [http://www.libsdl.org/index.php SDL] - Simple Directmedia Layer - a layer that allows LMMS to output it's sound to sound servers like aRts, esd (otherwise you need to kill them ''before'' starting LMMS)
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libsdl-sound1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev''
* [http://www.opensound.com/ OSS] - Open Sound System - now replaced by [http://www.alsa-project.org/ ALSA]

Even if you don't install all necessary libraries ''before'' configuring LMMS, you'll receive messages telling you what isn't in place to proceed, so you'll be able to fulfill the requirements ''while'' configuring LMMS, running ''./configure'' multiple times and resolving issues one at a time.


=== Optional (but strongly recommended) libraries ===

To make use of the full LMMS potential you may need to install some extra libraries. Here is a list of some of them:

* ogg-vorbis libraries - to decode/encode .ogg samples and/or songs
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libvorbis-dev libvorbisfile3 libvorbisenc2''
* samplerate conversion tools - to downsample and upsample audio from 4Hz up to 192kHz
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libsamplerate0-dev''
* asynchronous library for interfacing with the JACK sound server - to convert programs that do sound input or output via the OSS system into JACK clients by starting them with the jacklaunch command
* STK library + headers for using STK (Sound Synthesis Toolkit)
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libstk0-dev stk''
* WINE + devel-packages for being able to use VST-plugins within LMMS
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libwine-dev libwine''

Again, even if you don't install all the libraries '''before''' running cmake, you'll receive warnings afterwards. So remove CMakeCache.txt and run cmake again until you get the desired result.
