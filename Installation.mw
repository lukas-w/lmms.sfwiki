This is meant to be a very basic and linear tutorial on how to install LMMS.
Examples provided assume you're running Debian GNU/Linux.

== Installing LMMS from SVN ==

* First you need to get LMMS sources from the SVN repository, or update your sources, if you're upgrading from a previous version. The following command will checkout a recent SVN-copy of in a newly created folder named "lmms" in the current dir.
 svn co https://lmms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lmms/branches/lmms stable-0.3
* Then you have to configure LMMS: cd into the "stable-0.3" directory and generate the config script running
 make -f Makefile.svn
* configure LMMS by running
 ./configure
* resolve any unmet dependencies the configure script prompts you for (see section "[[Installation#Resolving_dependencies|Resolving dependencies]]" below for more on this topic)
* Now compile LMMS: cd into the sources directory (if you're not already there)
 make
* Finally you can install LMMS by running as root
 make install

== Resolving dependencies ==

To compile LMMS from sources you need several development libraries, from graphical to sound ones. Some are essential and some are optional.

=== Required libraries ===

* Qt 3.x libs and Qt 3.x development libs, both multithreaded
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libqt3-mt libqt3-mt-dev libqt3-headers qt3-dev-tools''
** under Fedora and RPM based system run ''yum install qt-devel''.  On 64-bit systems where you do not intend to compile 32-bit targets, run ''yum install qt-devel.x86_64'' so as not to install the 32-bit development libraries.
** On a 64 bit system that uses lib64qt3, it may be necessary to make some modifications before configure will find your qt libraries. The kludge that worked for me was editing configure, and replacing all occurances of '' $QTDIR/lib'' with ''$QTDIR/lib64''  --- ''[[removethis-west@gratainc.com|Alex West]] 2006/04/30 10:30 Mandriva 2006''
** Alternatively, on 64-bit systems you may be able to do ''./configure --with-qtdir=/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/''. --[[User:PaulWay|PaulWay]] 22:19, 18 November 2007 (PST)

Next you need to allow LMMS to communicate with your audio hardware, so you have to choose one or more of the following setups and provide corresponding development libraries:
* [http://www.alsa-project.org/ ALSA] - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture - apart from libs and -dev libs, you need ALSA modules for your soundcard (built-in with 2.6.x kernels) and those modules loaded - see [http://www.alsa-project.org/ http://www.alsa-project.org/] and [http://alsa.opensrc.org/ http://alsa.opensrc.org/] for info
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libasound2-dev''
* [http://jackaudio.org/ JACK] - Jack Audio Connection Kit - a low latency audio server that allows the connection of multiple applications to an audio device (typically an ALSA one), as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libjack0.100.0-dev libjackasyn-dev''
* [http://www.libsdl.org/index.php SDL] - Simple Directmedia Layer - a layer that allows LMMS to output it's sound to sound servers like aRts, esd (otherwise you need to kill them ''before'' starting LMMS)
** under Debian run ''aptitude install libsdl-sound1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev''
* [http://www.opensound.com/ OSS] - Open Sound System - now replaced by [http://www.alsa-project.org/ ALSA]

Even if you don't install all necessary libraries ''before'' configuring LMMS, you'll receive messages telling you what isn't in place to proceed, so you'll be able to fulfill the requirements ''while'' configuring LMMS, running ''./configure'' multiple times and resolving issues one at a time.

=== Optional (but strongly recommended) libraries ===

To make use of the full LMMS potential you may need to install some extra libraries. Here is a list of some of them:

* ogg-vorbis libraries - to decode/encode .ogg samples and/or songs
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libvorbis-dev libvorbisfile3 libvorbisenc2''
* samplerate conversion tools - to downsample and upsample audio from 4Hz up to 192kHz
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libsamplerate0-dev''
* sound file library - for reading and writing files containing sampled audio data
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libsndfile1-dev''
* asynchronous library for interfacing with the JACK sound server - to convert programs that do sound input or output via the OSS system into JACK clients by starting them with the jacklaunch command
* STK library + headers for using STK (Sound Synthesis Toolkit)
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libstk0-dev stk''
* WINE + devel-packages for being able to use VST-plugins within LMMS
** under Debian run aptitude install ''libwine-dev libwine''

Again, even if you don't install all the libraries '''before''' configuring LMMS, you'll receive warnings at the end of the configure process telling you what isn't in place to achieve the best setup, and you'll be able to get what's needed, again running ''./configure'' multiple times and installing software until you get the desired result.

== Installation under various distributions ==

=== Gentoo Linux ===

LMMS is now avaible for Gentoo in the "semi-official" overlay www.gentoo-sunrise.org.

So, Gentoo users who want to install LMMS only have to do:

 # emerge -va layman
 # echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf
 # layman -f -a sunrise
 # echo "media-sound/lmms ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
 # emerge -av lmms

This ebuild stills experimental and no-official so bugs shouldn't be reported on Gentoo's Bugzilla unless it's a problem with the ebuild and you write a patch (you can report this patch at bugs.gentoo.org on bug 100170). If you have any other problem with it, please contact me: cooldwind at gmail dot com.

=== Fedora ===

Fedora has (early) LMMS packages available in the Planet CCRMA repository [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetccrma/].
