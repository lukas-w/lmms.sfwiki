= How to use LFO Controllers =
The purpose of LFO controllers is to give you automation of controls using waveform patterns. You can make very creative pieces this way, and the method is also suited for live performance.

This subject has been excellently covered in a series of video tutorials on YouTube. We have the author's permission to link to these tutorials, and we recommend that you start with these:

Remember to experiment, experiment and experiment! There is almost no end to the creative possibilities.
