The purpose of LFO controllers are wave-form-pattern automation of controls. Very creative pieces can be made this way, and the method is also suited for live performance. 
This subject has been excellently covered in a series of video tutorials on youTube. I have the authors permission to link to his tutorials, and recommend anyone that are interested in this subject to start with these tutorials.

Currently (0.4.6 ) you will get a series of error-messages when you load a project that has LFO controllers. This will startle you (well, not now.. Now you know about it..:), but there is no reason for alarm. Even though LMMS will complain about the connections, the project will load correctly, and all connections are preserved.

Another thing that needs to me mentioned is that you should not connect zynAddSubFX to LFO controllers. This will lead to artifacts and strange behavior. 

Otherwise only one thing to say: Experiment, Experiment and Experiment! There is almost no end to the creative possibilities.
