Here is a list of VST's that have been found to work with LMMS. There is no guarantee that they will definitely work with your system. Think of it as a guide, please feel free to add any that you find to work also (or not). It is generally good practise to test a VST you haven't used before on a blank project, this way you won't lose any work you've done if it fails to load and causes LMMS to lock-up.

| {{rh}} |PC-2 Pschoacoustic compressor v1.0.1
| {{wikitable_cell}}|compressor
| {{Yes}}
| {{?}}
| {{No}}
| {{?}}
| {{wikitable_cell}}|Conventional compressors are based on peak or rms-level estimation to compute their time-variant gain or attenuation. This property of most compressors often causes undesirable intermodulation distortion and pumping/breathing artefacts.
PC-2 features a 'psycho-acoustic relevance' mode. Instead of using a peak or rms-level estimation, this mode employes a perceptual loudness model to compute the loudness of the input signal. This perceptual loudness model is combined with advanced attack and release stages that model peripheral adaptation of the human auditory nerve. The result is a very transparent compression characteristic, even with very short attack and release times.
On the other hand, the simple, classic compression behavior can be engaged too by simply switching off the complex loudness model.
