= Naming Articles =
All version-dependent article titles should begin with the conserned version number, followed by the actual title, with a ":" between the two. 
Here's an example: ''0.4:Manual''

= Translations =
All translations should be based on the English version. The articles' title should begin with the language's two-lettered ISO 639-1 code (Fr, De, Es, ...), followed by the LMMS version (if the article is version-dependent), followed by the actual title, in that language.  It wouldn't make much sense to translate articles leaving the titles in English, wouldn't it? Here are some examples: ''Fr:Page Principale, Fr:0.4:Manuel''. The English version doesn't need that part though.
