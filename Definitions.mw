; Freeze
: To freeze a song or bassline track is to pre-render its sound and play that rather than render the track in real time.  This allows you to render a very complex track that would otherwise take too much CPU time to play with all the other tracks in the song.  While a track is frozen, changes to it do not take effect.  When [[Definitions#T|thawed]], the changes will take effect and the track will once again be rendered in real time as the song progresses.  Tracks can only be frozen when playback is stopped.

; Project
: The entire package of instruments, tracks, patterns and settings that comprise the whole performance of the song.  This is what you save and load from the Project menu.

; Sample
: An individual audio file, used either in an [[#I|instrument]] (see [[AudioFileProcessor Plugin]]) or a [[#S|sample track]].
; Sample Track
: A type of [[#T|track]] that is designed to take audio files.  Multiple different [[#S|Samples]] can be placed in one sample track, and they can overlap.  See [[Working with Samples]].
; Segment
: A block in a [[#T|track]] that contains a sample (in the case of a [[#S|sample track]]), notes in a [[#P|piano roll]] or repeats of a [[#B|beat / bassline]].  Each type of [[#T|track]] only uses one type of segment.  See [[Song Editor]].
; Song
: The overall combination of [[#T|tracks]] playing simultaneously that makes up your composition.  See [[Song Editor]]
; Step
: One sixteenth of a bar in the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]]; a single 'tab' in the pattern display.

== T ==

; Thaw
: To unfreeze a track, rendering it again in real time during playback.  See [[Definitions#F|freeze]].
; Track
: A row in the [[Song Editor]] containing an instrument, sample track, or beat / bassline.
