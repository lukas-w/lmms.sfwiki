__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
Here are a list of terms used in LMMS and their meaning.

== A ==

; Automation
: Setting the position of a knob or other control in LMMS over time by a manually-drawn envelope.  Automation is edited in the [[Automation Editor]] for individual controls.  See the article on [[Working With Automation]] for a more task-oriented description.

== C ==

; Controller
: Setting the position of a knob or other control in LMMS over time by a generated envelope such as an [[Definitions#L|LFO]].  This differs from automation because automation is drawn manually by the user and is often not a repeated effect such as a sine, square or saw wave, whereas controllers use such waves to give a regular pattern to a control.

; Filter
: A filter alters the frequency spectrum of a sound coming out of an oscillator.  Common filters are low-pass (meaning low frequencies are let through), high-pass (allowing high frequencies through), notch (blocking a narrow range of frequencies), and band-pass (allowing only a narrow range of frequencies).  Filters, even in the digital world, cannot be truly linear - i.e. the graph of the filter's response over frequency shows a curved 'knee' dropping down rather than a vertical line.  This means that a low-pass filter set to 100Hz will let some frequencies lower than that through, although the lower the frequency the more it will be cut.  The steepness of the drop in a filter is called it's [[Definitions#Q|Q]] parameter.  Historically, some analogue filters also introduced 'resonance' or amplification of frequencies around the 'knee' point in the filter - this effect has been used in much electronic music and is included in LMMS.

; Freeze
: To freeze a song or bassline track is to pre-render its sound and play that rather than render the track in real time.  This allows you to render a very complex track that would otherwise take too much CPU time to play with all the other tracks in the song.  While a track is frozen, changes to it do not take effect.  When [[Definitions#T|thawed]], the changes will take effect and the track will once again be rendered in real time as the song progresses.  Tracks can only be frozen when playback is stopped.

; LFO
: Low Frequency Oscillator.  This typically refers to oscillators whose usual frequency is in the 0.1Hz - 10Hz range - i.e. from one beat every ten seconds to ten beats every second.  Above this frequency the oscillator is generating frequencies in the audible spectrum and the 'low frequency' prefix is not used.  LFOs are typically used to control things such as filter sweeps and amplitude oscillation ('vibrato').

; LMMS
: the Linux MultiMedia Studio.

== M ==

== O ==
== P ==

; Project
: The entire package of instruments, tracks, patterns and settings that comprise the whole performance of the song.  This is what you save and load from the Project menu.

== Q ==

; Q
: The steepness of the cutoff of a [[Definitions#F|filter]].

== R ==
== S ==

; Sample
: An individual audio file, used either in an [[#I|instrument]] (see [[AudioFileProcessor Plugin]]) or a [[#S|sample track]].
; Sample Track
: A type of [[#T|track]] that is designed to take audio files.  Multiple different [[#S|Samples]] can be placed in one sample track, and they can overlap.  See [[Working with Samples]].
; Segment
: A block in a [[#T|track]] that contains a sample (in the case of a [[#S|sample track]]), notes in a [[#P|piano roll]] or repeats of a [[#B|beat / bassline]].  Each type of [[#T|track]] only uses one type of segment.  See [[Song Editor]].
; Song
: The overall combination of [[#T|tracks]] playing simultaneously that makes up your composition.  See [[Song Editor]]
; Step
: One sixteenth of a bar in the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]]; a single 'tab' in the pattern display.

== T ==

; Thaw
: To unfreeze a track, rendering it again in real time during playback.  See [[Definitions#F|freeze]].
; Track
: A row in the [[Song Editor]] containing an instrument, sample track, or beat / bassline.
