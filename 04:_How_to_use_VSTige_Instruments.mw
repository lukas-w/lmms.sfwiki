VSTige is a standard. Read more on this here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology]
LMMS supports VST.
A list of tested VST can be found here: [[Tested VSTs]]. If you have found a VST that works well with LMMS, you can aid the community greatly by adding it to the list.

So, how to use..
When you have downloaded a VST package. Unpack it in the VST folder in your LMMS installation.
The package content is depending of how advanced the VST happen to bee, but there will always be a DLL. That is the actual software plug-in.
Some will have preset-files. Some even banks.
In respect to LMMS that is not of significant importance, because LMMS can create its own instrument-presets, but i have had no problems using 'banked' VSTs in LMMS anyways.

So..
Lets load one

Open a project

This next thing will sound silly, and it is.. But first: Save your project. I mention this because loading a VST is a major action, and you should always save before!

On the sidebars 1. option, drag an empty VSTige container into your project.

Open the instrument GUI (eg click on the instrument in the song-editor).

Smack in the middle to the right of the text "No VST Plugin loaded" we have a folder symbol.

Click this symbol.

Browse to the VST folder where you unpacked the download.

Click the DLL and wait for LMMS to load the VST.

When it loads, The VSTs GUI will be opend. 

OBS!!
Do not ever close this GUI on the windows 'x'
Always use the button on the LMMS GUI that says "Show/Hide GUI".
You will 'loose' the handle to the VST-GUI and waist RAM if you 'x' it out.

You now have a VST instrument and you can use it in your project.
Fiddle a litle with the knobs and sliders, now lets save it as a new preset. We need this because we also want to ''load'' a saved VST-type Preset, so name the instrument, and save it with the Save-button on the preset-GUI, into a folder in MyPresets in your LMMS installation.


We will now load this LMMS named, saved, VST-type instrument into a LMMS project.

The way i have found to work best is to use an empty VST container just as described above, so-

On the sidebars 1. option, drag an empty VSTige container into your project.

Open the instrument GUI (eg click on the instrument in the song-editor). It should open the default GUI. That makes it the "Active Instrument".

The existing VST-preset-instrument should be in the myPresets collection. Open myPresets (sidebar 4. button) and browse for the instrument.
when found, right-click it.

In the context-menu, choose: "Send to Active Instrument Track"

Wait for LMMS to finish.

If all went well LMMS opens the VST-GUI and your saved VST-instrument is ready for use.
