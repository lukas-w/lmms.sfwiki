= Key Mappings =

This is an attempt at a complete listing of what keys activate what functions in various parts of LMMS.  It also stands as a reference to try and tidy up LMMS in future so its interface is more consistent.

Standard key modifier notation: C, Shift-C, Ctrl-C, Alt-C, Alt-Shift-C.  Keep keys in numerical then alphabetical order, grouped by key modifier.  Mouse modifiers (e.g. shift-drag) go before keys.
