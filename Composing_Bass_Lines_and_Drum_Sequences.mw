Bass lines and drum sequences are repetitive patterns usually lasting one, or occasionally several, bars.  They are composed using the [[Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]], shown here:

= = Adição de novos instrumentos

Normalmente, você estará adicionando amostras de bateria e as notas do instrumento na Beat + Bassline Editor. Por este motivo, simplesmente clicando duas vezes sobre uma amostra ou pré-nos [Side [Bar]] irá adicioná-lo diretamente no Beat + Bassline Editor. Você também pode arrastar as amostras e presets para ele também e deixá-los na área livre na parte inferior da janela do editor. Você pode reorganizar a ordem dos instrumentos, arrastando faixas de seu punho pontilhado (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-settings-grabbar.png).

= = Padrões Compondo

Ao lado de cada plugin instrumento é uma exposição de batidas em um bar, dividido em etapas - quatro passos por batida em um bar de quatro tempos. Isso se assemelha a interface clássica do [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808 Roland TR-808], com quatro batidas sombreadas alternadamente para a referência fácil. Pressionando os botões etapa liga a nota nessa fase particular do bar, pressionando-o novamente desliga.

A melhor maneira de começar a sentir para isso é adicionar um baixo ou bumbo e um hat-oi to the Beat + Bassline Editor, virar no primeiro, quinto, nono e décimo terceiro passos (ou seja, o primeiro passo de cada batida do bar) e pressione o botão 'play' (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-toolbar-play.png). Isto irá iniciar o ritmo jogando em quatro batidas constantes em um bar. Então você pode virar botões dentro e fora de cada instrumento'', enquanto o ritmo está jogando''para ter uma idéia do som desse ritmo. Isto lhe dará uma sensação intuitiva para o som do ritmo de base, quando as notas são tocadas, e é a melhor maneira de aperfeiçoar um padrão.

= Philosophies of pattern design =

There are several schools of thought to pattern design, usually stemming from the kind of software one has used previously.  To illustrate the differences, imagine a typical 4/4 'trance' rhythm (the 'oontz-oontz-oontz-oontz' style: kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare) and a variation on that style with two snare hits instead of one at the end of the bar.

== One pattern per bar structure ==

This is probably the most common style of pattern in use.  Each separate pattern includes beats for all the instruments it uses.  In our example, you would have one pattern containing the kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare and one containing the kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare''snare''.

== Pattern and variations ==

Once again we have two patterns in our example.  The key change here is that the variation pattern ''only'' includes the snare hit on the last sixteenth of the bar.  In order to get the complete variation pattern, we sequence both the rhythm and the variation ''together'' in the Song Editor.

== One pattern per instrument ==

We now change our philosophy significantly by having three separate patterns.  One contains just the kick drum, common to both the rhythm and variation.  The second contains just the snare drum for the rhythm, and the third contains just the snare for the variation.  Once again, in order to get the complete effect you sequence the tracks together in the Song Editor.

== Which is best? ==

There are advantages and disadvantages to each of the above approaches:

* The first makes logical sense considered from a musical notation point of view, and is often easier to see the integration of all the instruments in the rhythm.  For instance, you will get a clearer picture of whether two instruments play on the same sixteenth using this method.
* However, the first means that you have to reprogram the entire rhythm for each minor variation.  It is often much quicker to simply program that second pattern to contain only the notes that vary.  On the other hand, this does not allow you to take out notes that are already in the 'base' pattern.
* This might logically suggest that a further break-down into common sections and their variations.
* The 'one instrument per pattern' method is the logical extension of this.  While it is often harder to compose the instruments individually, it is easy to combine them in new and novel ways in the Song Editor.
* Adding more tracks to separate out these individual differences, however, may make the rhythm tracks harder to manage and combine together.
* On the other hand, it often feels tiring to create yet another drum track for another slight variation in the rhythm, even when this might sound significantly better.  The temptation to reuse what is already there even if it sounds boring is one of the great causes of songs sounding dispirited and ordinary.

Ultimately, like so many things in the artistic world it is better to use the methods you are familiar with than to struggle with a way that someone else considers 'correct'.  For beginners I would recommend starting with the first or second methods until you have established a clear preference.  It is also very useful to pick and choose from the methods here as the situation dictates.

= Putting patterns into your song =

Naturally, the patterns by themselves do not create rhythms in your songs.  Using the editing tools in the [[Song Editor]], you 'draw' new areas for the rhythm to be active at any time in your song.  This also allows you to have a pattern that goes for a fraction of a bar (using the drag-with-control method); however, you cannot shrink a pattern to be less than the size of one bar.

One thing you need to be careful about is doubling ''identical'' events. Identical soundfiles playing on top of each other can come out absolutely horrid due to mutual amplifying! If you experience severe distortion in your drum pattern, make sure that identical sounds are not ‘stacked’.


== Natual variations ==
If you listen to a human drummer the fact that it is a human is obvious. The pattern has fine loudness variations as the drummer hits the drums with a ‘human touch’. This can be emulated and will indeed give your drumline much better quality.
Rest the mouse on a drumnote and then scroll your mouse-wheel. The note will change its color-intensity (brighter == louder, dimmer==lower). You can actually also open the drumpattern in the piano-roll (right-click, chose ‘Open in piano-roll’) and there use the loudness balks to control the individual note loudness.

= More than one bar? =

Sometimes you have a rhythm that that is two bars long; or one that repeats not every bar, but every two bars.  Sometimes it might make sense to create two patterns ('rhythm 1' and 'rhythm 2', for example) and alternate their use in the Song Editor.  However, LMMS caters specifically for this by allowing you to create patterns that are more than one bar long.

Simply right-click on the pattern buttons and choose the number of bars you want to add in the '''Add Steps''' submenu of the pattern's context menu.  This will allow you to increase the number of bars that ''this specific pattern'' takes.  Instruments that are not set to have this many steps will repeat every bar.  You can likewise remove steps using the '''Remove Steps''' submenu if you've changed your mind.

When adding a new pattern that is more than one bar long in the Song Editor, the initial pattern 'block' size will the same number of bars as the pattern.  However, once created, you can shrink or enlarge this in multiples of a single bar, thus allowing you to cut a multiple-bar pattern in mid-pattern.  The 'repeat' marks in these bars will be displayed at multiples of the pattern length, for easy identification.

= Not just the same note? =

The Beat + Bassline Editor can also be used to play instruments, not just drum samples.  This is where the word 'bassline' in the title comes from - it is commonly used to play the repetitive notes of a typical bassline in electronic music.  This saves a lot of the copy and paste process that would be required if you were composing for the instrument directly in a track of the Song Editor.

Using the standard pattern buttons as above, the sample will play its [[Working with Instruments#Base note|base note]].  However, sometimes you will have a repetitive bassline that does not play the same note all the time.  In this situation, right-click on the pattern buttons and choose '''Open in piano-roll'''.  This will open the [[Piano Roll Editor]] with a new pattern.  This pattern, too, can be any length (not just a single bar).

Putting notes in a piano roll is also useful for times when you need more notes, or more accuracy in placement, than the sixteen steps per bar of the Beat + Bassline Editor can give you.  It also allows you to vary the volume of each note.
