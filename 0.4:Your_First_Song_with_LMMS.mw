So you've just loaded up LMMS and you want to find your way around?  In this situation, programmers write a "hello world" program; we're going to write "Popcorn", a classic for the synthesizer that should be well known.

= Making the melody =

We now want to add notes to make the melody.  Left-click in the first bar of the Moog track and a new piano roll segment will appear (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/songeditor-track-segment-piano-empty.png).  Double-click on that and the [[Piano Roll Editor]] will appear, allowing you to put notes into that newly-created segment.

<!--{\end{center}}-->

== A primeira nota ==

Agora clique no quadrado preto à direita do A5 "(note que é de três linhas, ou semitons, abaixo da nota marcada C5). Isto irá criar uma nova mania - uma nota batida longa - a partir de que momento.

<!--{ \ Begin (center }}-->

<!--{ \ End (center }}-->

No entanto, isso é muito longa: precisamos de notas meio batida - uma colcheia - por muito tempo. Para mudar isso, basta mover o ponteiro do mouse para a borda direita da nota, até que o cursor muda para uma seta para a esquerda e direita. Então, segure o botão do mouse pressionado e arrastar o final da nota deixou dois "blocos" (cada bloco a ser um décimo sexto do bar).

<!--{ \ End (center }}-->

Depois disso, as novas notas que colocamos abaixo será o mesmo comprimento, porque o Piano Roll Editor está definida como última nota (http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/5366/pianorolltoolbarnotelen.png)

== More notes ==

Continue creating notes in the pattern shown:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/1610/firstbar.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

To place a note, you need to aim for the line at the start of the beat; LMMS will recognise a small fraction of the area left of the beat line as being closer to that beat than the previous.  If you make a mistake placing a note, you can move it to its correct position by clicking on the middle of the note (where the cursor turns into a four-way cross) and dragging the note to its new position.  LMMS will play the note that you're dragging onto as an aide to correct placement.  You can move notes horizontally (in time) as well as vertically (in pitch).

If you need to delete a note, simply right-click on it.

== Copy and paste ==

We now want to repeat those seven notes at the start of the bar in the next bar.  There are three ways to do this.

The first and worst way to do it is to simply click the correct notes. But this is tedious. Let's use some of LMMS's features to speed this up.

The first real way to do it is to use the duplicator tool. First select the notes you want to copy. Hold down Ctrl and make a selection rectangle around the notes you want to copy. Next, hold Shift and drag the newly selected notes. You are now dragging a copy of the selected notes. You can place these where you want them to go.

Alternatively you can use good old copy and paste. Again, use Ctrl to select the notes you want, and then press Ctrl+C. Press Ctrl+V to paste the notes, and move them to their new location.

To select all notes you can press Ctrl+A.

We can now press the '''play''' button (http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/2559/play.png) in the Piano Roll Editor window to play the melody back.  When it gets to the end of the last bar in which there are notes, it will automatically repeat back to the start of the first bar.

== Oops! ==

When we play the melody so far, we realize that the melody actually starts on the wrong beat.  The second A4 note is really supposed to be the start of the bar, and the two notes before it are leading in from the previous bar.  However, we can't go further back than bar 1 in our piano roll.  We need to move all the notes forward. Press Ctrl+A to select all the notes. Then you can click and drag to move them all over in order to have the first note start on the right beat.

== The first 'four' bars ==

If you're confident, you can now continue adding the notes of the tune to make the first four bars (up to where the main melody repeats).  Here's what your piano roll should look like at the end of this:

<!--{\end{center}}-->

= More structure =

We can now close the Piano Roll Editor and go back to the Song Editor.  You will see that the track segment that we initially double-clicked to create the melody has expanded out to fit the notes that we've added.

We now want to copy that segment to create the next four bars.  The easiest way to do that is to simply hold down the Ctrl key, then drag the initial segment.  This will drag a copy of the segment to a new location, which must be outside the initial segment.  This process will look like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/tutorial-1stsong/ctrl-drag-copying.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

Drop the segment on bar 6.  This is actually one bar too late, as the first three quarters of a bar of this segment is empty, as is the last quarter of the last segment.  Fortunately, segments can overlap and their notes will play simultaneously.<sup><small>[[Your First Song with LMMS#Footnotes| [3]]]</small></sup>.  Drag the second copy so that it starts at bar 5.

You can now play this using the play button in the Song Editor.  You will hear a short pause as it counts the first three beats of silence, then the melody will start.  It should play smoothly through the two repeats.

The Song Editor should now look like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/tutorial-1stsong/songeditor-8bars.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

== Variation 2 ==

We can now go on to create another piano roll segment and fill in the next four bars:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/tutorial-1stsong/variation-2.png
<!--{\end{center}}-->

Due to the way that the segments overlap, you will have to create the new segment in a new bar (e.g. bar 11) and then move it into position over the previous segment.

Note that there is a slight oddity in the Piano Roll Editor that causes you to start editing at bar 2 when opening occasional new segments.  Check which bar you're writing notes into before getting to far!

Your Song Editor should now look like this:

= Footnotes =

[[Your First Song with LMMS#Choosing the instrument| [1]]] - You could alternatively have dropped it on the existing "TripleOscillator: Default" track to replace that instrument with the one you were dragging, but this gives you an idea of how to create new instrument tracks.

[[Your First Song with LMMS#Copy and paste| [2]]] - As of version 0.3.1, the copy and paste functionality in the Piano Roll Editor has several known problems.  The developers are aware of these problems and plan to fix them in a future release.

[[Your First Song with LMMS#More structure| [3]]] - You should avoid having segments that overlap as there is no clear display of how many segments overlap in a particular area.  A small segment might completely disappear behind a large one, leaving you confused as to where those extra notes were coming from.  In this case, it makes good sense to use it.
