{{0.4:Tool BarTrans}}

(23. juli 10: this page (and subpages) needs new pictures from the 0.4.6 GUI theese updates are in progress)

The Tool Bar is at the top of the window, permanently underneath the [[0.4:Main Menu Bar|Main Menu Bar]].  It looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->

<!--{\end{center}}-->

(In 0.4.6 this has changed. The changes are not dramatic, but there are some buttons that has been removed:
* Quality
* Auto Limit 
The speed-bar buttons are arranged in 2 rows. 
The top row is all about project-handling.
The bottom row has buttons for toggling the different LMMS GUIs.
The colors are also a litle different.)

= File Controls =


The six buttons in the top row deal with opening and saving files.

The '''New Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-new-project.png) creates a new song.  By clicking on the drop-down symbol on the right hand side of the icon, you will get a list of pre-set templates that can be used to fill out your new song with instruments and configure it ready for work.

The "New-Project-from-Template button" will allow the use of saved templates for new projects.

The '''Open existing Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-open-project.png) opens an existing song file in your LMMS Working Directory.

The "Resently Opend project" button allow you see and browse files that you resently have saved succesfully in LMMS. If you have opend a file and not saved it due to a crash or other similar circumstances,  the file will not be in the list!  

The '''Save current Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-save.png) saves the current project. If you have not yet saved the project you will be prompted for a name and location to save it.

The '''Export Project''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-export.png) is a shortcut to exports of the current project as a WAV or OGG file. You will get the same options for quality as in the menu's export-option.

= Window Controls =

  
The seven buttons in the second row shows or hides various windows.  When clicked, the action depends on the location of the corresponding window.  If the window selected is not at the front of the LMMS window, it is brought to the front.  If it is at the front, it is closed.  If it is closed, it is opened and brought to the front.  -Or in other words : These buttons are toggle-buttons for LMMS's components. The contents of the window do not disappear when the window is closed.

All GUIs has a useful feature. If you right-click in the top-mostleft cornor, LMMS opens a context menu. The option 'Stay in front' will alow that specific window to overlay all other windows. This is especially useful for the FX-mixer, but also for certain special tricks that will allow you to do real-time editing doing replay. See [[04: Real-time edits]].

The Toggle buttons are:

The Song-editor-toggle-button. is the '''Song Editor Window''' toggle-button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-songeditor.png) shows or hides the [[0.4:Song Editor|Song Editor]].

The '''Beat + Bassline Editor Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-bassline.png) shows or hides the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat + Bassline Editor]].

The '''Piano Roll Editor Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-pianoroll.png) shows or hides the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor|Piano Roll Editor]].  If you click the toggle-button in an ''empty'' (new) projet, an empty Piano-Roll window will open, and a message will be shown: "Please open a pattern by double-clicking on it" You cannot edit notes in ''this'' window. What LMMS says is that you opend an Piano-roll editor-window, that ''does not link'' to any track! Use the windows-x or the toggle-button to close this orphant-window.
however - Piano-roll windows that has been opend with a  double-click in a piano roll segment (block) will open the Piano-roll-editor window ''linked'' to the track that you clicked in! -and you can ''now'' edit its notes. 

The '''Automation Window''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-automation.png) shows or hides the global-song [[0.4:Automation Editor|Automation Editor]] window. Global-song automation is different from track-automation. You get access to global-song-automation by right-clicking a LMMS control, and then choose "Edit song-global automation", in the context-menu. ''This'' action will then open the Automation-editor, and you can create an automation-track that is specific for the controll that you access the context-menu from. There are however no visual 'reminders' from this action. In other words: If you do use  "song-global-automation" you should definately make a note in the project-notes. There are afaik no obvious reason to use "song-global-automation". I would definately recommend using an automation track instead, and name it and place it directly next to the track that it controlls.
OBS!! Toggling the (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-automation.png) in an ''empty'' project can crash LMMS!

The FX-mixer-toggle-button. Show / hide the FX-mixer

The '''Project Notes''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-notes.png) shows or hides the [[0.4:Project Notes|Project Notes]] window.

The Controller-rack-toggle-button. Show / hide the Controller-rack.

= Tempo Control =

The current '''tempo''' (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-tempo.png) is shown in numerals.  This is a standard control, so it can be changed by dragging up and down inside it and it can be automated from its context menu.

= Time Signature Controls =
The default time signature is 4/4. You can change this by mouse-dragging. The separator in the Piano-roll will automatically adapt to the chosen time-signature.


= Sound Quality Controls =

Beneath the tempo control versions earlier than 0.4.5 had two controls that set the quality of the sound produced by LMMS.

The '''High Quality''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-highquality.png) turns on use of higher precision mathematics in all the instruments.  This would generally increase the quality of the sound - reducing artifacts and obvious clipping - at the expense of increased CPU usage.  It may also alter the sound of some [[LADSPA]] effects, particularly reverbs.

The '''Auto Limit''' button (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-autolimit.png) activated a soft limiting function that prevents the sound from hitting the maximum or minimum extents of the 16-bit precision of a WAV file.  This can make some sounds softer but will avoid having clipping if a chance resonance or constructive interference should occur during your song.

Both these buttons was removed in 0.4.6.
If your LMMS has these buttons, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the newest version of LMMS:
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/download.php

= Volume and Pitch Controls =

To the right of the tempo control are the master volume and pitch controls.

The '''Master Volume''' control (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-master-volume.png) sets the master volume for the entire song.

The '''Master Pitch''' control (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-master-pitch.png) sets the 'root' note on which every other note in the song is based.  Turn this down to make the piece play at a lower pitch, and vice versa.  This can be useful if you have programmed a reproduction of another song to be in a certain key and, upon checking it against the original, find the original to be in a different key.

= Wave and CPU Usage Display =

Finally, the '''Wave / CPU Display''' (http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-wave-cpu.png) displays the current waveform being played during playback and the current CPU usage of all the LMMS instruments, effects and sequencing.  You can turn the wave display off or on by clicking it, although this does little to reduce CPU usage.
