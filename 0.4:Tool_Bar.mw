{{0.4:Tool BarTrans}}

The Tool Bar is at the top of the window, permanently underneath the [[0.4:Main Menu Bar|Main Menu Bar]].  It looks like this:

<!--{\begin{center}}-->
[[file:main-menu-icons.png]]
<!--{\end{center}}-->

In 0.4.6 this has changed. The changes are not dramatic, but there are some buttons that have been removed:
* Quality
* Auto Limit 
The speed-bar buttons are arranged in 2 rows. 
The top row is all about project-handling.
The bottom row has buttons for toggling the different LMMS GUIs.

= File Controls =


The six buttons in the top row deal with opening and saving files.

[[file:menubar1-new.png]] The '''Create New Project''' button creates a new project. 

[[file:menubar2-template.png]] The '''Create New Project From Template''' button will allow the use of saved templates for new projects. By clicking on the dropdown arrow on the right hand side of the icon, you will get a list of templates that can be used to fill out your new project with instruments and configure it ready for work.

[[file:menubar3-open.png]] The '''Open Existing Project''' button opens an existing project file from your LMMS Working Directory.

[[file:menubar4-recently.png]] The '''Recently Opened Project''' button lists files that you have saved recently in LMMS. If you have opened a file and not saved it due to a crash or other similar circumstances, the file will not be in the list.

[[file:menubar5-save.png]] The '''Save Current Project''' button saves the current project. If you have not yet saved the project you will be prompted for a name and location to save it.

[[file:menubar6-export.png]] The '''Export Current Project''' button is a shortcut to exports of the current project as a WAV or OGG file. You will get the same options for quality as in the menu's Export option.

= Window Controls =

  
The 7 buttons in the 2nd row show or hide various workspace windows. When clicked, the action depends on the current state of that window. If the window selected is not at the front of the LMMS window, it is brought to the front. If it is at the front, it is closed. If it is closed, it is opened, and brought to the front. In other words: these are toggle buttons for the workspace windows. The contents of the window are not lost when the window is closed.

All GUIs have a context menu icon in the top left corner of its window. Click the icon to open the context menu. The '''Stay On Top''' option keeps that window on top of all other windows. This is especially useful for the FX-mixer, and also for some special tricks it allows you to do while during song playback [[0.4:Composing in the Piano Roll Editor#Real-Time Edits|real-time editing]].

The Toggle buttons are:

[[file:menubar-f5-songeditor.png]] The '''Song-Editor''' toggle-button shows/hides the [[0.4:Song Editor|Song Editor]].

[[file:menubar-f6-bb-editor.png]] The '''Beat+Bassline Editor''' button shows/hides the [[0.4:Beat Bassline Editor|Beat+Bassline Editor]].

[[file:menubar-f7-pianoroll.png]] The '''Piano Roll Editor Window''' button shows/hides the [[0.4:Piano Roll Editor|Piano Roll Editor]]. If you click the toggle-button in an ''empty'' (new) project, an empty Piano-Roll window will open, and the message will be shown: "Please open a pattern by double-clicking on it!" You cannot edit in ''this'' window, because you opened a Piano-Roll editor window that ''is not linked'' to any track! You must close this orphaned window. However, Piano-roll windows that you open by double-clicking a block in the Song-Editor (or a segment in the Beat+Baseline Editor) will open the Piano-roll editor window ''linked'' to the track that you clicked in, and you can ''now'' edit its notes. 

[[file:menubar-f8-automation.png]] The '''Automation Window''' button shows/hides the global-song [[0.4:Automation Editor|Automation Editor]] window. Global-song automation is different from track-automation. You get access to global-song-automation by right-clicking a LMMS control, and then choose "Edit song-global automation", in the context-menu. ''This'' action will then open the Automation-Editor window, and you can create an automation-track that is specific to that control. Warning: there are no visual 'reminders' that you created this automation. In other words: if you decide to use  "song-global-automation" you should definitely make a note of it in the project-notes window. There is (afaik) no obvious reason to use "song-global-automation". It is highly recommended that you use track-automation instead, name it, and place it directly next to the track that it controls.

[[file:menubar-f9-mixer.png]] The '''FX-mixer''' toggle-button shows/hides the FX-mixer.

[[file:menubar-f10-projectnotes.png]] The '''Project Notes''' button shows/hides the [[0.4:Project Notes|Project Notes]] window. These are notes to remind yourself why you did things the way you did them.

[[file:menubar-f11-controller rack.png]] The '''Controller-rack''' toggle-button shows/hides the Controller-rack.

= Tempo Control =

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/65/Tempo-bpm.png   The current '''tempo''' is shown in numerals. This is a standard control, so it can be changed by dragging up and down inside it and it can be automated from its context menu (rightclick).

= Time Signature Controls =
http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/6/67/Time_sig.png   The default '''time signature''' is 4/4. You can change this by mouse-dragging. The separator in the Piano-roll will automatically adapt to the chosen time-signature.

= (Sound Quality Controls) =

Beneath the tempo control versions earlier than 0.4.5 had two controls that set the quality of the sound produced by LMMS.

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-highquality.png The '''High Quality''' button turns on use of higher precision mathematics in all the instruments.  This would generally increase the quality of the sound - reducing artifacts and obvious clipping - at the expense of increased CPU usage.  It may also alter the sound of some [[LADSPA]] effects, particularly reverbs.

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-autolimit.png The '''Auto Limit''' button activated a soft limiting function that prevents the sound from hitting the maximum or minimum extents of the 16-bit precision of a WAV file.  This can make some sounds softer but will avoid having clipping if a chance resonance or constructive interference should occur during your song.

Both buttons have been removed since version 0.4.6.
If your LMMS has these buttons, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the newest version of LMMS:

= Volume and Pitch Controls =

To the right of the tempo control are the master volume and pitch controls.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/5/52/Master-volume.png The '''Master Volume''' control sets the master volume for the entire song.

http://lmms.sourceforge.net/wiki/images/8/8d/Master-pitch.png The '''Master Pitch''' control sets the 'root' note on which every other note in the song is based. Turn this down to make the piece play at a lower pitch, and vice versa. This can be useful if you have programmed a reproduction of a song to be in a certain key, and after checking it against the original, you find the original to be in a different key.

= Wave and CPU Usage Display =

http://tangram.dnsalias.net/lmms-imgs/lmms-0.3.1/toolbar-wave-cpu.png Finally, the '''Wave / CPU Display''' displays the current waveform being played during playback and the current CPU usage of all the LMMS instruments, effects and sequencing.  You can turn the wave display off or on by clicking it, although this does little to reduce CPU usage.
