{{OrganicTrans}}

Organic is an additive synthesizer which combines the output of up to 8 oscillators. Although it has more oscillators than the [[TripleOscillator]] it is less flexible because it lacks a lot of its abilities, among them the option to modulate the oscillators with each other.

The phase offsets of each oscillator are randomized whenever a note is played (for both stereo channels separately). For that reason this instrument sounds slightly different everytime you press a key even when you don't change any settings.

Organic is most useful for creating organ instruments (that's where its name comes from) and pads.

==Individual oscillator controls==
*'''Wave:''' The waveform generated by the oscillator.
** 0%: Sine
** 1%: Sawtooth
** 2%: Pulse
** 3%: Triangle
** 4%: Moog Triangle
** 5%: Exponential
*'''Vol:''' Volume of the oscillator.
*'''Pan:''' Stereo panning of the oscillator.
*'''Wide:''' Coarse of the oscillator. Has a range of one octave up- and down.

==General controls==
*'''Dist:''' Adds a clipper effect (distortion)
*'''Vol:''' General volume
*'''Randomise:''' Randomises all oscillator settings.

== Tuning of the oscillators==
This is the default coarse of the oscillators with "Wide" on +/- 0
